It tells the story of Alice, who falls down a rabbit hole into a fantastical world populated by strange creatures. The novel features such classic scenes as the Mad Hatter's tea party and the Queen's croquet game. Alice gets bored sitting by her sister and sees a white rabbit with a pocket watch. She chases it and falls down a rabbit hole. Alice falls down a very deep well, and has plenty of time to look around as she falls. She sees that the well is filled with shelves and cupboards, and takes down a jar of orange marmalade. She wonders how far she has fallen and if she will ever reach the bottom. Alice is falling down a rabbit hole and wonders aloud about the different things she's passing. She wonders if she'll fall all the way through the earth and come out in Australia or New Zealand. Alice gets sleepy and continues to talk to herself. Alice falls asleep and dreams that she is talking to Dinah, her cat. In the dream, she asks Dinah if she has ever eaten a bat. Suddenly, Alice wakes up and finds herself in a long, dark hallway. She sees a small table with a golden key on it and tries to use the key to unlock one of the doors in the hallway, but it doesn't work. Alice is sad and wonders how she will ever get out of the hallway. Alice finds a door in a hall that is too small for her to fit through. She tries to open it with a key, but it does not work. She then finds a bottle on the table with a label that says \"Drink Me.\" Alice finds a bottle labeled \"Drink Me\" and decides to take a sip. She shrinks down to ten inches tall and is excited to enter the garden through the small door. Alice is worried that she might go out like a candle, and wonders what she would be like then. She tries to imagine what a candle's flame looks like after the candle is blown out, but she can't remember ever having seen such a thing.\n\nAlice decides to go into the garden, but she forgets the key and can't reach it. She gets tired and sits down to cry.\n\nAlice tells herself to stop crying and that it's no use to pretend to be two people. She thinks that there's hardly enough of her left to make one respectable person. Alice finds a cake that makes her grow larger, and she uses it to reach a key that will allow her into the garden. Alice is planning to be kind to her feet by giving them new boots for Christmas, but she finds it difficult to do so. She eventually meets the White Rabbit, who is dressed splendidly. Alice meets a rabbit who is in a hurry and drops his gloves and fan. Alice picks them up and begins talking to the rabbit, but he runs away. Alice wonders if she has been changed overnight and tries to remember who she is.\n\nLast chunk: in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, \u201cOh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won\u2019t she be savage if I\u2019ve kept her waiting!\u201d Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, \u201cIf you please, sir\u2014\u201d The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.  Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: \u201cDear, dear! How queer everything is to-day!

It tells the story of Alice, who falls down a rabbit hole into a fantastical world populated by strange creatures. The novel features such classic scenes as the Mad Hatter's tea party and the Queen's croquet game. Alice gets bored sitting by her sister and sees a white rabbit with a pocket watch. She chases it and falls down a rabbit hole. Alice falls down a very deep well, and has plenty of time to look around as she falls. She sees that the well is filled with shelves and cupboards, and takes down a jar of orange marmalade. She wonders how far she has fallen and if she will ever reach the bottom. Alice is falling down a rabbit hole and wonders aloud about the different things she's passing. She wonders if she'll fall all the way through the earth and come out in Australia or New Zealand. Alice gets sleepy and continues to talk to herself. Alice falls asleep and dreams that she is talking to Dinah, her cat. In the dream, she asks Dinah if she has ever eaten a bat. Suddenly, Alice wakes up and finds herself in a long, dark hallway. She sees a small table with a golden key on it and tries to use the key to unlock one of the doors in the hallway, but it doesn't work. Alice is sad and wonders how she will ever get out of the hallway. Alice finds a door in a hall that is too small for her to fit through. She tries to open it with a key, but it does not work. She then finds a bottle on the table with a label that says \"Drink Me.\" Alice finds a bottle labeled \"Drink Me\" and decides to take a sip. She shrinks down to ten inches tall and is excited to enter the garden through the small door. Alice is worried that she might go out like a candle, and wonders what she would be like then. She tries to imagine what a candle's flame looks like after the candle is blown out, but she can't remember ever having seen such a thing.\n\nAlice decides to go into the garden, but she forgets the key and can't reach it. She gets tired and sits down to cry.\n\nAlice tells herself to stop crying and that it's no use to pretend to be two people. She thinks that there's hardly enough of her left to make one respectable person. Alice finds a cake that makes her grow larger, and she uses it to reach a key that will allow her into the garden. Alice is planning to be kind to her feet by giving them new boots for Christmas, but she finds it difficult to do so. She eventually meets the White Rabbit, who is dressed splendidly. Alice meets a rabbit who is in a hurry and drops his gloves and fan. Alice picks them up and begins talking to the rabbit, but he runs away. Alice wonders if she has been changed overnight and tries to remember who she is. Alice is confused about who she is and wonders if she has been changed into someone else. She decides that if she is indeed someone else, she would rather stay down where she is than go upstairs. Alice is surprised to find herself shrinking, and even more surprised to find herself in the sea. She wonders if she can take the train back. Alice finds herself in a pool of tears, and meets a mouse. She wonders if the mouse knows the way out, and tries to ask it in English. The mouse doesn't seem to understand, but winks at her.

It tells the story of Alice, who falls down a rabbit hole into a fantastical world populated by strange creatures. The novel features such classic scenes as the Mad Hatter's tea party and the Queen's croquet game. Alice gets bored sitting by her sister and sees a white rabbit with a pocket watch. She chases it and falls down a rabbit hole. Alice falls down a very deep well, and has plenty of time to look around as she falls. She sees that the well is filled with shelves and cupboards, and takes down a jar of orange marmalade. She wonders how far she has fallen and if she will ever reach the bottom. Alice is falling down a rabbit hole and wonders aloud about the different things she's passing. She wonders if she'll fall all the way through the earth and come out in Australia or New Zealand. Alice gets sleepy and continues to talk to herself. Alice falls asleep and dreams that she is talking to Dinah, her cat. In the dream, she asks Dinah if she has ever eaten a bat. Suddenly, Alice wakes up and finds herself in a long, dark hallway. She sees a small table with a golden key on it and tries to use the key to unlock one of the doors in the hallway, but it doesn't work. Alice is sad and wonders how she will ever get out of the hallway. Alice finds a door in a hall that is too small for her to fit through. She tries to open it with a key, but it does not work. She then finds a bottle on the table with a label that says \"Drink Me.\" Alice finds a bottle labeled \"Drink Me\" and decides to take a sip. She shrinks down to ten inches tall and is excited to enter the garden through the small door. Alice is worried that she might go out like a candle, and wonders what she would be like then. She tries to imagine what a candle's flame looks like after the candle is blown out, but she can't remember ever having seen such a thing.\n\nAlice decides to go into the garden, but she forgets the key and can't reach it. She gets tired and sits down to cry.\n\nAlice tells herself to stop crying and that it's no use to pretend to be two people. She thinks that there's hardly enough of her left to make one respectable person. Alice finds a cake that makes her grow larger, and she uses it to reach a key that will allow her into the garden. Alice is planning to be kind to her feet by giving them new boots for Christmas, but she finds it difficult to do so. She eventually meets the White Rabbit, who is dressed splendidly. Alice meets a rabbit who is in a hurry and drops his gloves and fan. Alice picks them up and begins talking to the rabbit, but he runs away. Alice wonders if she has been changed overnight and tries to remember who she is. Alice is confused about who she is and wonders if she has been changed into someone else. She decides that if she is indeed someone else, she would rather stay down where she is than go upstairs. Alice is surprised to find herself shrinking, and even more surprised to find herself in the sea. She wonders if she can take the train back. Alice finds herself in a pool of tears, and meets a mouse. She wonders if the mouse knows the way out, and tries to ask it in English. The mouse doesn't seem to understand, but winks at her. Alice encounters a mouse who is terrified of cats. The mouse explains that his family has always hated cats, and he doesn't want to hear their name again. Alice meets a mouse who is afraid of cats and dogs. The mouse tells Alice its story, and then they all swim to shore. The animals on the bank are trying to figure out how to dry off, and the Mouse takes charge. The Mouse explains that the best way to dry off is to listen to a story. The story is about William the Conqueror. The Mouse is telling the Duck about how the archbishop found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown. However, the Duck interrupts and does not seem to understand what the Mouse is saying.\n\nLast chunk: a shiver.  \u201cI beg your pardon!\u201d said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: \u201cDid you speak?\u201d  \u201cNot I!\u201d said the Lory hastily.  \u201cI thought you did,\u201d said the Mouse. \u201c\u2014I proceed. \u2018Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable\u2014\u2019\u201d  \u201cFound _what_?\u201d said the Duck.  \u201cFound _it_,\u201d the Mouse replied rather crossly: \u201cof course you know what \u2018it\u2019 means.\u201d  \u201cI know what \u2018it\u2019 means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,\u201d said the Duck: \u201cit\u2019s generally a frog or a worm.

Alice finds herself in a pool of tears, and meets a mouse. She wonders if the mouse knows the way out, and tries to ask it in English. The mouse doesn't seem to understand, but winks at her. Alice encounters a mouse who is terrified of cats. The mouse explains that his family has always hated cats, and he doesn't want to hear their name again. Alice meets a mouse who is afraid of cats and dogs. The mouse tells Alice its story, and then they all swim to shore. The animals on the bank are trying to figure out how to dry off, and the Mouse takes charge. The Mouse explains that the best way to dry off is to listen to a story. The story is about William the Conqueror. The Mouse is telling the Duck about how the archbishop found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown. However, the Duck interrupts and does not seem to understand what the Mouse is saying. The passage describes a race in which everyone wins and Alice is chosen to give out the prizes. Alice finds a box of comfits and hands them out as prizes. The Mouse insists that Alice should have a prize too, so the Dodo presents her with a thimble. They all eat the comfits, and then the Mouse tells them his story. The Mouse tells Alice a story, but gets angry and walks away before finishing. Alice and the others beg the Mouse to come back and finish the story, but it refuses.\n\nLast chunk: long tail, certainly,\u201d said Alice, looking down with wonder at the Mouse\u2019s tail; \u201cbut why do you call it sad?\u201d And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was something like this:\u2014           \u201cFury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, \u2018Let us both          go to law: _I_ will prosecute _you_.\u2014Come, I\u2019ll take no          denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning I\u2019ve          nothing to do.\u2019 Said the mouse to the cur, \u2018Such a trial, dear          sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.\u2019          \u2018I\u2019ll be judge, I\u2019ll be jury,\u2019 Said cunning old Fury: \u2018I\u2019ll          try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.\u2019\u201d  \u201cYou are not attending!\u201d said the Mouse to Alice severely. \u201cWhat are you thinking of?\u201d  \u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d said Alice very humbly: \u201cyou had got to the fifth bend, I think?\u201d  \u201cI had _not!_\u201d cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.  \u201cA knot!\u201d said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking anxiously about her. \u201cOh, do let me help to undo it!\u201d  \u201cI shall do nothing of the sort,\u201d said the Mouse, getting up and walking away. \u201cYou insult me by talking such nonsense!\u201d  \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it!\u201d pleaded poor Alice. \u201cBut you\u2019re so easily offended, you know!\u201d  The Mouse only growled in reply.  \u201cPlease come back and finish your story!\u201d Alice called after it; and the others all joined in chorus, \u201cYes, please do!\u201d but the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.\n\nNext chunk:", "completion": " \u201cWhat a pity it wouldn\u2019t stay!\u201d sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter \u201cAh, my dear!

It tells the story of Alice, who falls down a rabbit hole into a fantastical world populated by strange creatures. The novel features such classic scenes as the Mad Hatter's tea party and the Queen's croquet game. Alice gets bored sitting by her sister and sees a white rabbit with a pocket watch. She chases it and falls down a rabbit hole. Alice falls down a very deep well, and has plenty of time to look around as she falls. She sees that the well is filled with shelves and cupboards, and takes down a jar of orange marmalade. She wonders how far she has fallen and if she will ever reach the bottom. Alice is falling down a rabbit hole and wonders aloud about the different things she's passing. She wonders if she'll fall all the way through the earth and come out in Australia or New Zealand. Alice gets sleepy and continues to talk to herself. Alice falls asleep and dreams that she is talking to Dinah, her cat. In the dream, she asks Dinah if she has ever eaten a bat. Suddenly, Alice wakes up and finds herself in a long, dark hallway. She sees a small table with a golden key on it and tries to use the key to unlock one of the doors in the hallway, but it doesn't work. Alice is sad and wonders how she will ever get out of the hallway. Alice finds a door in a hall that is too small for her to fit through. She tries to open it with a key, but it does not work. She then finds a bottle on the table with a label that says \"Drink Me.\" Alice finds a bottle labeled \"Drink Me\" and decides to take a sip. She shrinks down to ten inches tall and is excited to enter the garden through the small door. Alice is worried that she might go out like a candle, and wonders what she would be like then. She tries to imagine what a candle's flame looks like after the candle is blown out, but she can't remember ever having seen such a thing.\n\nAlice decides to go into the garden, but she forgets the key and can't reach it. She gets tired and sits down to cry.\n\nAlice tells herself to stop crying and that it's no use to pretend to be two people. She thinks that there's hardly enough of her left to make one respectable person. Alice finds a cake that makes her grow larger, and she uses it to reach a key that will allow her into the garden. Alice is planning to be kind to her feet by giving them new boots for Christmas, but she finds it difficult to do so. She eventually meets the White Rabbit, who is dressed splendidly. Alice meets a rabbit who is in a hurry and drops his gloves and fan. Alice picks them up and begins talking to the rabbit, but he runs away. Alice wonders if she has been changed overnight and tries to remember who she is. Alice is confused about who she is and wonders if she has been changed into someone else.

She also finds a bottle and drinks from it.\n\nLast chunk: can find them.\u201d As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name \u201cW. RABBIT,\u201d engraved upon it. She went in without knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves.  \u201cHow queer it seems,\u201d Alice said to herself, \u201cto be going messages for a rabbit! I suppose Dinah\u2019ll be sending me on messages next!\u201d And she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: \u201c\u2018Miss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready for your walk!\u2019 \u2018Coming in a minute, nurse! But I\u2019ve got to see that the mouse doesn\u2019t get out.\u2019 Only I don\u2019t think,\u201d Alice went on, \u201cthat they\u2019d let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that!\u201d  By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this time with the words \u201cDRINK ME,\u201d but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. \u201cI know _something_ interesting is sure to happen,\u201d she said to herself, \u201cwhenever I eat or drink anything; so I\u2019ll just see what this bottle does.

It tells the story of Alice, who falls down a rabbit hole into a fantastical world populated by strange creatures. The novel features such classic scenes as the Mad Hatter's tea party and the Queen's croquet game. Alice gets bored sitting by her sister and sees a white rabbit with a pocket watch. She chases it and falls down a rabbit hole. Alice falls down a very deep well, and has plenty of time to look around as she falls. She sees that the well is filled with shelves and cupboards, and takes down a jar of orange marmalade. She wonders how far she has fallen and if she will ever reach the bottom. Alice is falling down a rabbit hole and wonders aloud about the different things she's passing. She wonders if she'll fall all the way through the earth and come out in Australia or New Zealand. Alice gets sleepy and continues to talk to herself. Alice falls asleep and dreams that she is talking to Dinah, her cat. In the dream, she asks Dinah if she has ever eaten a bat. Suddenly, Alice wakes up and finds herself in a long, dark hallway. She sees a small table with a golden key on it and tries to use the key to unlock one of the doors in the hallway, but it doesn't work. Alice is sad and wonders how she will ever get out of the hallway. Alice finds a door in a hall that is too small for her to fit through. She tries to open it with a key, but it does not work. She then finds a bottle on the table with a label that says \"Drink Me.\" Alice finds a bottle labeled \"Drink Me\" and decides to take a sip. She shrinks down to ten inches tall and is excited to enter the garden through the small door. Alice is worried that she might go out like a candle, and wonders what she would be like then. She tries to imagine what a candle's flame looks like after the candle is blown out, but she can't remember ever having seen such a thing.\n\nAlice decides to go into the garden, but she forgets the key and can't reach it. She gets tired and sits down to cry.\n\nAlice tells herself to stop crying and that it's no use to pretend to be two people. She thinks that there's hardly enough of her left to make one respectable person. Alice finds a cake that makes her grow larger, and she uses it to reach a key that will allow her into the garden. Alice is planning to be kind to her feet by giving them new boots for Christmas, but she finds it difficult to do so. She eventually meets the White Rabbit, who is dressed splendidly. Alice meets a rabbit who is in a hurry and drops his gloves and fan. Alice picks them up and begins talking to the rabbit, but he runs away. Alice wonders if she has been changed overnight and tries to remember who she is. Alice is confused about who she is and wonders if she has been changed into someone else. She decides that if she is indeed someone else, she would rather stay down where she is than go upstairs. Alice is surprised to find herself shrinking, and even more surprised to find herself in the sea. She wonders if she can take the train back. Alice finds herself in a pool of tears, and meets a mouse. She wonders if the mouse knows the way out, and tries to ask it in English. The mouse doesn't seem to understand, but winks at her. Alice encounters a mouse who is terrified of cats. The mouse explains that his family has always hated cats, and he doesn't want to hear their name again. Alice meets a mouse who is afraid of cats and dogs. The mouse tells Alice its story, and then they all swim to shore. The animals on the bank are trying to figure out how to dry off, and the Mouse takes charge. The Mouse explains that the best way to dry off is to listen to a story. The story is about William the Conqueror. The Mouse is telling the Duck about how the archbishop found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown. However, the Duck interrupts and does not seem to understand what the Mouse is saying. The passage describes a race in which everyone wins and Alice is chosen to give out the prizes. Alice finds a box of comfits and hands them out as prizes. The Mouse insists that Alice should have a prize too, so the Dodo presents her with a thimble. They all eat the comfits, and then the Mouse tells them his story. The Mouse tells Alice a story, but gets angry and walks away before finishing. Alice and the others beg the Mouse to come back and finish the story, but it refuses. Alice talks to a Lory and a Crab about her pet cat, Dinah. The mention of Dinah's predilection for catching and eating birds causes a stir among the other animals, who all hurry off. Alice is left alone, wondering if she will ever see her cat again.

It tells the story of Alice, who falls down a rabbit hole into a fantastical world populated by strange creatures. The novel features such classic scenes as the Mad Hatter's tea party and the Queen's croquet game. Alice gets bored sitting by her sister and sees a white rabbit with a pocket watch. She chases it and falls down a rabbit hole. Alice falls down a very deep well, and has plenty of time to look around as she falls. She sees that the well is filled with shelves and cupboards, and takes down a jar of orange marmalade. She wonders how far she has fallen and if she will ever reach the bottom. Alice is falling down a rabbit hole and wonders aloud about the different things she's passing. She wonders if she'll fall all the way through the earth and come out in Australia or New Zealand. Alice gets sleepy and continues to talk to herself. Alice falls asleep and dreams that she is talking to Dinah, her cat. In the dream, she asks Dinah if she has ever eaten a bat. Suddenly, Alice wakes up and finds herself in a long, dark hallway. She sees a small table with a golden key on it and tries to use the key to unlock one of the doors in the hallway, but it doesn't work. Alice is sad and wonders how she will ever get out of the hallway. Alice finds a door in a hall that is too small for her to fit through. She tries to open it with a key, but it does not work. She then finds a bottle on the table with a label that says \"Drink Me.\" Alice finds a bottle labeled \"Drink Me\" and decides to take a sip. She shrinks down to ten inches tall and is excited to enter the garden through the small door. Alice is worried that she might go out like a candle, and wonders what she would be like then. She tries to imagine what a candle's flame looks like after the candle is blown out, but she can't remember ever having seen such a thing.\n\nAlice decides to go into the garden, but she forgets the key and can't reach it. She gets tired and sits down to cry.\n\nAlice tells herself to stop crying and that it's no use to pretend to be two people. She thinks that there's hardly enough of her left to make one respectable person. Alice finds a cake that makes her grow larger, and she uses it to reach a key that will allow her into the garden. Alice is planning to be kind to her feet by giving them new boots for Christmas, but she finds it difficult to do so. She eventually meets the White Rabbit, who is dressed splendidly. Alice meets a rabbit who is in a hurry and drops his gloves and fan. Alice picks them up and begins talking to the rabbit, but he runs away. Alice wonders if she has been changed overnight and tries to remember who she is. Alice is confused about who she is and wonders if she has been changed into someone else. She decides that if she is indeed someone else, she would rather stay down where she is than go upstairs. Alice is surprised to find herself shrinking, and even more surprised to find herself in the sea. She wonders if she can take the train back. Alice finds herself in a pool of tears, and meets a mouse. She wonders if the mouse knows the way out, and tries to ask it in English. The mouse doesn't seem to understand, but winks at her. Alice encounters a mouse who is terrified of cats. The mouse explains that his family has always hated cats, and he doesn't want to hear their name again. Alice meets a mouse who is afraid of cats and dogs. The mouse tells Alice its story, and then they all swim to shore. The animals on the bank are trying to figure out how to dry off, and the Mouse takes charge. The Mouse explains that the best way to dry off is to listen to a story. The story is about William the Conqueror. The Mouse is telling the Duck about how the archbishop found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown. However, the Duck interrupts and does not seem to understand what the Mouse is saying. The passage describes a race in which everyone wins and Alice is chosen to give out the prizes. Alice finds a box of comfits and hands them out as prizes. The Mouse insists that Alice should have a prize too, so the Dodo presents her with a thimble. They all eat the comfits, and then the Mouse tells them his story. The Mouse tells Alice a story, but gets angry and walks away before finishing. Alice and the others beg the Mouse to come back and finish the story, but it refuses. Alice talks to a Lory and a Crab about her pet cat, Dinah. The mention of Dinah's predilection for catching and eating birds causes a stir among the other animals, who all hurry off. Alice is left alone, wondering if she will ever see her cat again. The White Rabbit is looking for his fan and gloves, and Alice tries to help. The Rabbit gets angry and tells Alice to go get them, so she runs off. Alice finds a house with a brass plate that says \"W. Rabbit\" and goes in. She finds a room with a fan and gloves and picks them up. She also finds a bottle and drinks from it. Alice drank from a magic bottle and grew until she was too large for the room. She was uncomfortable and wished she could go home. Alice is in the middle of a room with no way to escape and no room to grow. She meets a rabbit who tells her she should be learning lessons. Alice hears a Rabbit and an unknown voice arguing, followed by the sound of breaking glass. She makes a couple of attempts to grab the Rabbit, but each time only manages to break more glass.

Alice wonders if she has been changed overnight and tries to remember who she is. Alice is confused about who she is and wonders if she has been changed into someone else. She decides that if she is indeed someone else, she would rather stay down where she is than go upstairs. Alice is surprised to find herself shrinking, and even more surprised to find herself in the sea. She wonders if she can take the train back. Alice finds herself in a pool of tears, and meets a mouse. She wonders if the mouse knows the way out, and tries to ask it in English. The mouse doesn't seem to understand, but winks at her. Alice encounters a mouse who is terrified of cats. The mouse explains that his family has always hated cats, and he doesn't want to hear their name again. Alice meets a mouse who is afraid of cats and dogs. The mouse tells Alice its story, and then they all swim to shore. The animals on the bank are trying to figure out how to dry off, and the Mouse takes charge. The Mouse explains that the best way to dry off is to listen to a story. The story is about William the Conqueror. The Mouse is telling the Duck about how the archbishop found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown. However, the Duck interrupts and does not seem to understand what the Mouse is saying. The passage describes a race in which everyone wins and Alice is chosen to give out the prizes. Alice finds a box of comfits and hands them out as prizes. The Mouse insists that Alice should have a prize too, so the Dodo presents her with a thimble. They all eat the comfits, and then the Mouse tells them his story. The Mouse tells Alice a story, but gets angry and walks away before finishing. Alice and the others beg the Mouse to come back and finish the story, but it refuses. Alice talks to a Lory and a Crab about her pet cat, Dinah. The mention of Dinah's predilection for catching and eating birds causes a stir among the other animals, who all hurry off. Alice is left alone, wondering if she will ever see her cat again. The White Rabbit is looking for his fan and gloves, and Alice tries to help. The Rabbit gets angry and tells Alice to go get them, so she runs off. Alice finds a house with a brass plate that says \"W. Rabbit\" and goes in. She finds a room with a fan and gloves and picks them up. She also finds a bottle and drinks from it. Alice drank from a magic bottle and grew until she was too large for the room. She was uncomfortable and wished she could go home. Alice is in the middle of a room with no way to escape and no room to grow. She meets a rabbit who tells her she should be learning lessons. Alice hears a Rabbit and an unknown voice arguing, followed by the sound of breaking glass. She makes a couple of attempts to grab the Rabbit, but each time only manages to break more glass. Eventually she gets fed up and wishes she could be pulled out of the window. A little animal is scratching and scrambling in the chimney close to Alice. She kicks it, and Bill falls out of the chimney. Alice encounters a group of rabbits who tell her to go away. She then finds herself in a room full of cakes, which she eats, and shrinks. Alice shrinks and runs into a crowd of animals and birds. They all attack her, but she escapes into a thick wood. She then decides her first task is to grow back to her normal size, and the second is to find the garden. While she is peering around, an enormous puppy appears and scares her. She offers it a stick and it jumps away.\n\nLast chunk: she began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a thick wood.  \u201cThe first thing I\u2019ve got to do,\u201d said Alice to herself, as she wandered about in the wood, \u201cis to grow to my right size again; and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be the best plan.\u201d  It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry.  An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. \u201cPoor little thing!\u201d said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.  Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its\n\nNext chunk:", "completion": " feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.

It tells the story of Alice, who falls down a rabbit hole into a fantastical world populated by strange creatures. The novel features such classic scenes as the Mad Hatter's tea party and the Queen's croquet game. Alice gets bored sitting by her sister and sees a white rabbit with a pocket watch. She chases it and falls down a rabbit hole. Alice falls down a very deep well, and has plenty of time to look around as she falls. She sees that the well is filled with shelves and cupboards, and takes down a jar of orange marmalade. She wonders how far she has fallen and if she will ever reach the bottom. Alice is falling down a rabbit hole and wonders aloud about the different things she's passing. She wonders if she'll fall all the way through the earth and come out in Australia or New Zealand. Alice gets sleepy and continues to talk to herself. Alice falls asleep and dreams that she is talking to Dinah, her cat. In the dream, she asks Dinah if she has ever eaten a bat. Suddenly, Alice wakes up and finds herself in a long, dark hallway. She sees a small table with a golden key on it and tries to use the key to unlock one of the doors in the hallway, but it doesn't work. Alice is sad and wonders how she will ever get out of the hallway. Alice finds a door in a hall that is too small for her to fit through. She tries to open it with a key, but it does not work. She then finds a bottle on the table with a label that says \"Drink Me.\" Alice finds a bottle labeled \"Drink Me\" and decides to take a sip. She shrinks down to ten inches tall and is excited to enter the garden through the small door. Alice is worried that she might go out like a candle, and wonders what she would be like then. She tries to imagine what a candle's flame looks like after the candle is blown out, but she can't remember ever having seen such a thing.\n\nAlice decides to go into the garden, but she forgets the key and can't reach it. She gets tired and sits down to cry.\n\nAlice tells herself to stop crying and that it's no use to pretend to be two people. She thinks that there's hardly enough of her left to make one respectable person. Alice finds a cake that makes her grow larger, and she uses it to reach a key that will allow her into the garden.

She then finds a bottle on the table with a label that says \"Drink Me.\" Alice finds a bottle labeled \"Drink Me\" and decides to take a sip. She shrinks down to ten inches tall and is excited to enter the garden through the small door. Alice is worried that she might go out like a candle, and wonders what she would be like then. She tries to imagine what a candle's flame looks like after the candle is blown out, but she can't remember ever having seen such a thing.\n\nAlice decides to go into the garden, but she forgets the key and can't reach it. She gets tired and sits down to cry.\n\nAlice tells herself to stop crying and that it's no use to pretend to be two people. She thinks that there's hardly enough of her left to make one respectable person. Alice finds a cake that makes her grow larger, and she uses it to reach a key that will allow her into the garden. Alice is planning to be kind to her feet by giving them new boots for Christmas, but she finds it difficult to do so. She eventually meets the White Rabbit, who is dressed splendidly. Alice meets a rabbit who is in a hurry and drops his gloves and fan. Alice picks them up and begins talking to the rabbit, but he runs away. Alice wonders if she has been changed overnight and tries to remember who she is. Alice is confused about who she is and wonders if she has been changed into someone else. She decides that if she is indeed someone else, she would rather stay down where she is than go upstairs. Alice is surprised to find herself shrinking, and even more surprised to find herself in the sea. She wonders if she can take the train back. Alice finds herself in a pool of tears, and meets a mouse. She wonders if the mouse knows the way out, and tries to ask it in English. The mouse doesn't seem to understand, but winks at her. Alice encounters a mouse who is terrified of cats. The mouse explains that his family has always hated cats, and he doesn't want to hear their name again. Alice meets a mouse who is afraid of cats and dogs. The mouse tells Alice its story, and then they all swim to shore. The animals on the bank are trying to figure out how to dry off, and the Mouse takes charge. The Mouse explains that the best way to dry off is to listen to a story. The story is about William the Conqueror. The Mouse is telling the Duck about how the archbishop found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown. However, the Duck interrupts and does not seem to understand what the Mouse is saying. The passage describes a race in which everyone wins and Alice is chosen to give out the prizes. Alice finds a box of comfits and hands them out as prizes. The Mouse insists that Alice should have a prize too, so the Dodo presents her with a thimble. They all eat the comfits, and then the Mouse tells them his story. The Mouse tells Alice a story, but gets angry and walks away before finishing. Alice and the others beg the Mouse to come back and finish the story, but it refuses. Alice talks to a Lory and a Crab about her pet cat, Dinah. The mention of Dinah's predilection for catching and eating birds causes a stir among the other animals, who all hurry off. Alice is left alone, wondering if she will ever see her cat again. The White Rabbit is looking for his fan and gloves, and Alice tries to help. The Rabbit gets angry and tells Alice to go get them, so she runs off. Alice finds a house with a brass plate that says \"W. Rabbit\" and goes in. She finds a room with a fan and gloves and picks them up. She also finds a bottle and drinks from it. Alice drank from a magic bottle and grew until she was too large for the room. She was uncomfortable and wished she could go home. Alice is in the middle of a room with no way to escape and no room to grow. She meets a rabbit who tells her she should be learning lessons. Alice hears a Rabbit and an unknown voice arguing, followed by the sound of breaking glass. She makes a couple of attempts to grab the Rabbit, but each time only manages to break more glass. Eventually she gets fed up and wishes she could be pulled out of the window. A little animal is scratching and scrambling in the chimney close to Alice. She kicks it, and Bill falls out of the chimney. Alice encounters a group of rabbits who tell her to go away. She then finds herself in a room full of cakes, which she eats, and shrinks. Alice shrinks and runs into a crowd of animals and birds. They all attack her, but she escapes into a thick wood. She then decides her first task is to grow back to her normal size, and the second is to find the garden. While she is peering around, an enormous puppy appears and scares her. She offers it a stick and it jumps away. Alice meets a puppy and plays with it for a while, before realizing that she is too small. She wonders how she will grow up again, and decides she needs to eat or drink something. Alice meets a blue caterpillar smoking a hookah and they have a conversation. The caterpillar asks Alice who she is and Alice replies that she doesn't quite know, as she feels she has changed several times since that morning. The caterpillar tells Alice to explain herself and Alice tries, but finds she cannot because she doesn't understand it herself. The Caterpillar tells Alice that she will someday turn into a butterfly, but Alice is not sure if she believes it. The Caterpillar then tells Alice that she has something important to say, and Alice decides to listen.\n\nLast chunk: different sizes in a day is very confusing.\u201d  \u201cIt isn\u2019t,\u201d said the Caterpillar.  \u201cWell, perhaps you haven\u2019t found it so yet,\u201d said Alice; \u201cbut when you have to turn into a chrysalis\u2014you will some day, you know\u2014and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you\u2019ll feel it a little queer, won\u2019t you?\u201d  \u201cNot a bit,\u201d said the Caterpillar.  \u201cWell, perhaps your feelings may be different,\u201d said Alice; \u201call I know is, it would feel very queer to _me_.\u201d  \u201cYou!\u201d said the Caterpillar contemptuously. \u201cWho are _you?_\u201d  Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation. Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar\u2019s making such _very_ short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, \u201cI think, you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first.\u201d  \u201cWhy?\u201d said the Caterpillar.  Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.  \u201cCome back!\u201d the Caterpillar called after her. \u201cI\u2019ve something important to say!\u201d  This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.  \u201cKeep your temper,\u201d said the Caterpillar.  \u201cIs that all?\u201d said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she could.  \u201cNo,\u201d said the Caterpillar.  Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing.

It tells the story of Alice, who falls down a rabbit hole into a fantastical world populated by strange creatures. The novel features such classic scenes as the Mad Hatter's tea party and the Queen's croquet game. Alice gets bored sitting by her sister and sees a white rabbit with a pocket watch. She chases it and falls down a rabbit hole. Alice falls down a very deep well, and has plenty of time to look around as she falls. She sees that the well is filled with shelves and cupboards, and takes down a jar of orange marmalade. She wonders how far she has fallen and if she will ever reach the bottom. Alice is falling down a rabbit hole and wonders aloud about the different things she's passing. She wonders if she'll fall all the way through the earth and come out in Australia or New Zealand. Alice gets sleepy and continues to talk to herself. Alice falls asleep and dreams that she is talking to Dinah, her cat. In the dream, she asks Dinah if she has ever eaten a bat. Suddenly, Alice wakes up and finds herself in a long, dark hallway. She sees a small table with a golden key on it and tries to use the key to unlock one of the doors in the hallway, but it doesn't work. Alice is sad and wonders how she will ever get out of the hallway. Alice finds a door in a hall that is too small for her to fit through. She tries to open it with a key, but it does not work. She then finds a bottle on the table with a label that says \"Drink Me.\" Alice finds a bottle labeled \"Drink Me\" and decides to take a sip. She shrinks down to ten inches tall and is excited to enter the garden through the small door. Alice is worried that she might go out like a candle, and wonders what she would be like then. She tries to imagine what a candle's flame looks like after the candle is blown out, but she can't remember ever having seen such a thing.\n\nAlice decides to go into the garden, but she forgets the key and can't reach it.

It tells the story of Alice, who falls down a rabbit hole into a fantastical world populated by strange creatures. The novel features such classic scenes as the Mad Hatter's tea party and the Queen's croquet game. Alice gets bored sitting by her sister and sees a white rabbit with a pocket watch. She chases it and falls down a rabbit hole. Alice falls down a very deep well, and has plenty of time to look around as she falls. She sees that the well is filled with shelves and cupboards, and takes down a jar of orange marmalade. She wonders how far she has fallen and if she will ever reach the bottom. Alice is falling down a rabbit hole and wonders aloud about the different things she's passing. She wonders if she'll fall all the way through the earth and come out in Australia or New Zealand. Alice gets sleepy and continues to talk to herself. Alice falls asleep and dreams that she is talking to Dinah, her cat. In the dream, she asks Dinah if she has ever eaten a bat. Suddenly, Alice wakes up and finds herself in a long, dark hallway. She sees a small table with a golden key on it and tries to use the key to unlock one of the doors in the hallway, but it doesn't work. Alice is sad and wonders how she will ever get out of the hallway. Alice finds a door in a hall that is too small for her to fit through. She tries to open it with a key, but it does not work. She then finds a bottle on the table with a label that says \"Drink Me.\" Alice finds a bottle labeled \"Drink Me\" and decides to take a sip. She shrinks down to ten inches tall and is excited to enter the garden through the small door. Alice is worried that she might go out like a candle, and wonders what she would be like then. She tries to imagine what a candle's flame looks like after the candle is blown out, but she can't remember ever having seen such a thing.\n\nAlice decides to go into the garden, but she forgets the key and can't reach it. She gets tired and sits down to cry.\n\nAlice tells herself to stop crying and that it's no use to pretend to be two people. She thinks that there's hardly enough of her left to make one respectable person. Alice finds a cake that makes her grow larger, and she uses it to reach a key that will allow her into the garden. Alice is planning to be kind to her feet by giving them new boots for Christmas, but she finds it difficult to do so. She eventually meets the White Rabbit, who is dressed splendidly. Alice meets a rabbit who is in a hurry and drops his gloves and fan. Alice picks them up and begins talking to the rabbit, but he runs away. Alice wonders if she has been changed overnight and tries to remember who she is. Alice is confused about who she is and wonders if she has been changed into someone else. She decides that if she is indeed someone else, she would rather stay down where she is than go upstairs. Alice is surprised to find herself shrinking, and even more surprised to find herself in the sea. She wonders if she can take the train back. Alice finds herself in a pool of tears, and meets a mouse. She wonders if the mouse knows the way out, and tries to ask it in English. The mouse doesn't seem to understand, but winks at her. Alice encounters a mouse who is terrified of cats. The mouse explains that his family has always hated cats, and he doesn't want to hear their name again. Alice meets a mouse who is afraid of cats and dogs. The mouse tells Alice its story, and then they all swim to shore. The animals on the bank are trying to figure out how to dry off, and the Mouse takes charge. The Mouse explains that the best way to dry off is to listen to a story. The story is about William the Conqueror. The Mouse is telling the Duck about how the archbishop found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown. However, the Duck interrupts and does not seem to understand what the Mouse is saying. The passage describes a race in which everyone wins and Alice is chosen to give out the prizes. Alice finds a box of comfits and hands them out as prizes. The Mouse insists that Alice should have a prize too, so the Dodo presents her with a thimble. They all eat the comfits, and then the Mouse tells them his story. The Mouse tells Alice a story, but gets angry and walks away before finishing. Alice and the others beg the Mouse to come back and finish the story, but it refuses. Alice talks to a Lory and a Crab about her pet cat, Dinah. The mention of Dinah's predilection for catching and eating birds causes a stir among the other animals, who all hurry off. Alice is left alone, wondering if she will ever see her cat again. The White Rabbit is looking for his fan and gloves, and Alice tries to help. The Rabbit gets angry and tells Alice to go get them, so she runs off. Alice finds a house with a brass plate that says \"W. Rabbit\" and goes in. She finds a room with a fan and gloves and picks them up. She also finds a bottle and drinks from it. Alice drank from a magic bottle and grew until she was too large for the room. She was uncomfortable and wished she could go home. Alice is in the middle of a room with no way to escape and no room to grow. She meets a rabbit who tells her she should be learning lessons. Alice hears a Rabbit and an unknown voice arguing, followed by the sound of breaking glass. She makes a couple of attempts to grab the Rabbit, but each time only manages to break more glass. Eventually she gets fed up and wishes she could be pulled out of the window. A little animal is scratching and scrambling in the chimney close to Alice. She kicks it, and Bill falls out of the chimney. Alice encounters a group of rabbits who tell her to go away. She then finds herself in a room full of cakes, which she eats, and shrinks. Alice shrinks and runs into a crowd of animals and birds. They all attack her, but she escapes into a thick wood. She then decides her first task is to grow back to her normal size, and the second is to find the garden. While she is peering around, an enormous puppy appears and scares her. She offers it a stick and it jumps away. Alice meets a puppy and plays with it for a while, before realizing that she is too small. She wonders how she will grow up again, and decides she needs to eat or drink something. Alice meets a blue caterpillar smoking a hookah and they have a conversation. The caterpillar asks Alice who she is and Alice replies that she doesn't quite know, as she feels she has changed several times since that morning. The caterpillar tells Alice to explain herself and Alice tries, but finds she cannot because she doesn't understand it herself. The Caterpillar tells Alice that she will someday turn into a butterfly, but Alice is not sure if she believes it. The Caterpillar then tells Alice that she has something important to say, and Alice decides to listen. The Caterpillar is speaking to Alice, and comments on how she seems to have changed. Alice replies that she can't remember things as well as she used to, and the Caterpillar asks what she can't remember. Alice then recites a poem about an old man, and the Caterpillar comments on her performance. The Caterpillar and Alice have a conversation in which the Caterpillar contradicts Alice several times. Alice gets angry and eventually the Caterpillar relents, allowing Alice to grow three inches. Alice is talking to a caterpillar, who tells her that she will get used to the creatures being easily offended.

Alice tries to figure out which side is which, and ends up eating a piece of the mushroom that makes her foot shrink.\n\nLast chunk: of herself, \u201cI wish the creatures wouldn\u2019t be so easily offended!\u201d  \u201cYou\u2019ll get used to it in time,\u201d said the Caterpillar; and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.

She sees that the well is filled with shelves and cupboards, and takes down a jar of orange marmalade. She wonders how far she has fallen and if she will ever reach the bottom. Alice is falling down a rabbit hole and wonders aloud about the different things she's passing. She wonders if she'll fall all the way through the earth and come out in Australia or New Zealand. Alice gets sleepy and continues to talk to herself. Alice falls asleep and dreams that she is talking to Dinah, her cat. In the dream, she asks Dinah if she has ever eaten a bat. Suddenly, Alice wakes up and finds herself in a long, dark hallway. She sees a small table with a golden key on it and tries to use the key to unlock one of the doors in the hallway, but it doesn't work. Alice is sad and wonders how she will ever get out of the hallway. Alice finds a door in a hall that is too small for her to fit through. She tries to open it with a key, but it does not work. She then finds a bottle on the table with a label that says \"Drink Me.\" Alice finds a bottle labeled \"Drink Me\" and decides to take a sip. She shrinks down to ten inches tall and is excited to enter the garden through the small door. Alice is worried that she might go out like a candle, and wonders what she would be like then. She tries to imagine what a candle's flame looks like after the candle is blown out, but she can't remember ever having seen such a thing.\n\nAlice decides to go into the garden, but she forgets the key and can't reach it. She gets tired and sits down to cry.\n\nAlice tells herself to stop crying and that it's no use to pretend to be two people. She thinks that there's hardly enough of her left to make one respectable person. Alice finds a cake that makes her grow larger, and she uses it to reach a key that will allow her into the garden. Alice is planning to be kind to her feet by giving them new boots for Christmas, but she finds it difficult to do so. She eventually meets the White Rabbit, who is dressed splendidly. Alice meets a rabbit who is in a hurry and drops his gloves and fan. Alice picks them up and begins talking to the rabbit, but he runs away. Alice wonders if she has been changed overnight and tries to remember who she is. Alice is confused about who she is and wonders if she has been changed into someone else. She decides that if she is indeed someone else, she would rather stay down where she is than go upstairs. Alice is surprised to find herself shrinking, and even more surprised to find herself in the sea. She wonders if she can take the train back. Alice finds herself in a pool of tears, and meets a mouse. She wonders if the mouse knows the way out, and tries to ask it in English. The mouse doesn't seem to understand, but winks at her. Alice encounters a mouse who is terrified of cats. The mouse explains that his family has always hated cats, and he doesn't want to hear their name again. Alice meets a mouse who is afraid of cats and dogs. The mouse tells Alice its story, and then they all swim to shore. The animals on the bank are trying to figure out how to dry off, and the Mouse takes charge. The Mouse explains that the best way to dry off is to listen to a story. The story is about William the Conqueror. The Mouse is telling the Duck about how the archbishop found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown. However, the Duck interrupts and does not seem to understand what the Mouse is saying. The passage describes a race in which everyone wins and Alice is chosen to give out the prizes. Alice finds a box of comfits and hands them out as prizes. The Mouse insists that Alice should have a prize too, so the Dodo presents her with a thimble. They all eat the comfits, and then the Mouse tells them his story. The Mouse tells Alice a story, but gets angry and walks away before finishing. Alice and the others beg the Mouse to come back and finish the story, but it refuses. Alice talks to a Lory and a Crab about her pet cat, Dinah. The mention of Dinah's predilection for catching and eating birds causes a stir among the other animals, who all hurry off. Alice is left alone, wondering if she will ever see her cat again. The White Rabbit is looking for his fan and gloves, and Alice tries to help. The Rabbit gets angry and tells Alice to go get them, so she runs off. Alice finds a house with a brass plate that says \"W. Rabbit\" and goes in. She finds a room with a fan and gloves and picks them up. She also finds a bottle and drinks from it. Alice drank from a magic bottle and grew until she was too large for the room. She was uncomfortable and wished she could go home. Alice is in the middle of a room with no way to escape and no room to grow. She meets a rabbit who tells her she should be learning lessons. Alice hears a Rabbit and an unknown voice arguing, followed by the sound of breaking glass. She makes a couple of attempts to grab the Rabbit, but each time only manages to break more glass. Eventually she gets fed up and wishes she could be pulled out of the window. A little animal is scratching and scrambling in the chimney close to Alice. She kicks it, and Bill falls out of the chimney. Alice encounters a group of rabbits who tell her to go away. She then finds herself in a room full of cakes, which she eats, and shrinks. Alice shrinks and runs into a crowd of animals and birds. They all attack her, but she escapes into a thick wood. She then decides her first task is to grow back to her normal size, and the second is to find the garden. While she is peering around, an enormous puppy appears and scares her. She offers it a stick and it jumps away. Alice meets a puppy and plays with it for a while, before realizing that she is too small. She wonders how she will grow up again, and decides she needs to eat or drink something. Alice meets a blue caterpillar smoking a hookah and they have a conversation. The caterpillar asks Alice who she is and Alice replies that she doesn't quite know, as she feels she has changed several times since that morning. The caterpillar tells Alice to explain herself and Alice tries, but finds she cannot because she doesn't understand it herself. The Caterpillar tells Alice that she will someday turn into a butterfly, but Alice is not sure if she believes it. The Caterpillar then tells Alice that she has something important to say, and Alice decides to listen. The Caterpillar is speaking to Alice, and comments on how she seems to have changed. Alice replies that she can't remember things as well as she used to, and the Caterpillar asks what she can't remember. Alice then recites a poem about an old man, and the Caterpillar comments on her performance. The Caterpillar and Alice have a conversation in which the Caterpillar contradicts Alice several times. Alice gets angry and eventually the Caterpillar relents, allowing Alice to grow three inches. Alice is talking to a caterpillar, who tells her that she will get used to the creatures being easily offended. The caterpillar then tells her that one side of the mushroom will make her grow taller, and the other side will make her grow shorter. Alice tries to figure out which side is which, and ends up eating a piece of the mushroom that makes her foot shrink. Alice finds herself with a long neck in a sea of green leaves. She tries to move her hands but can't see them. A pigeon comes and beats her. The Pigeon is complaining about the serpents, and Alice is trying to explain that she is not a serpent. The Pigeon is not convinced.\n\nLast chunk: again!\u201d repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, \u201cI\u2019ve tried every way, and nothing seems to suit them!\u201d  \u201cI haven\u2019t the least idea what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d said Alice.  \u201cI\u2019ve tried the roots of trees, and I\u2019ve tried banks, and I\u2019ve tried hedges,\u201d the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; \u201cbut those serpents!

The Caterpillar tells Alice that she will someday turn into a butterfly, but Alice is not sure if she believes it. The Caterpillar then tells Alice that she has something important to say, and Alice decides to listen. The Caterpillar is speaking to Alice, and comments on how she seems to have changed. Alice replies that she can't remember things as well as she used to, and the Caterpillar asks what she can't remember. Alice then recites a poem about an old man, and the Caterpillar comments on her performance. The Caterpillar and Alice have a conversation in which the Caterpillar contradicts Alice several times. Alice gets angry and eventually the Caterpillar relents, allowing Alice to grow three inches. Alice is talking to a caterpillar, who tells her that she will get used to the creatures being easily offended. The caterpillar then tells her that one side of the mushroom will make her grow taller, and the other side will make her grow shorter. Alice tries to figure out which side is which, and ends up eating a piece of the mushroom that makes her foot shrink. Alice finds herself with a long neck in a sea of green leaves. She tries to move her hands but can't see them. A pigeon comes and beats her. The Pigeon is complaining about the serpents, and Alice is trying to explain that she is not a serpent. The Pigeon is not convinced. Alice encounters a pigeon who accuses her of being a serpent in disguise. Alice denies this, but the pigeon insists that all serpents must eat eggs. This frustrates Alice, who is not looking for eggs. Alice comes across a house in a clearing and wonders how to get to the garden. She is hesitant to approach the house because she doesn't want to frighten whoever lives there. She eventually decides to approach the house and is greeted by two footmen. One of the footmen has a letter for the Duchess, which Alice is curious about.\n\nLast chunk: as usual. \u201cCome, there\u2019s half my plan done now! How puzzling all these changes are! I\u2019m never sure what I\u2019m going to be, from one minute to another! However, I\u2019ve got back to my right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden\u2014how _is_ that to be done, I wonder?\u201d As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high. \u201cWhoever lives there,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cit\u2019ll never do to come upon them _this_ size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!\u201d So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.     CHAPTER VI. Pig and Pepper   For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood\u2014(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a fish)\u2014and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.  The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn tone, \u201cFor the Duchess. An invitation\n\nNext chunk:", "completion": " from the Queen to play croquet.\u201d The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the words a little, \u201cFrom the Queen.

Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.  Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.  \u201cThere\u2019s no sort of use in knocking,\u201d said the Footman, \u201cand that for two reasons.

Alice is transported back to the real world, where she wakes up from her dream.\n\nStory so far:  Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a novel by Lewis Carroll. It tells the story of Alice, who falls down a rabbit hole into a fantastical world populated by strange creatures. The novel features such classic scenes as the Mad Hatter's tea party and the Queen's croquet game. Alice gets bored sitting by her sister and sees a white rabbit with a pocket watch. She chases it and falls down a rabbit hole. Alice falls down a very deep well, and has plenty of time to look around as she falls. She sees that the well is filled with shelves and cupboards, and takes down a jar of orange marmalade. She wonders how far she has fallen and if she will ever reach the bottom. Alice is falling down a rabbit hole and wonders aloud about the different things she's passing. She wonders if she'll fall all the way through the earth and come out in Australia or New Zealand. Alice gets sleepy and continues to talk to herself. Alice falls asleep and dreams that she is talking to Dinah, her cat. In the dream, she asks Dinah if she has ever eaten a bat. Suddenly, Alice wakes up and finds herself in a long, dark hallway. She sees a small table with a golden key on it and tries to use the key to unlock one of the doors in the hallway, but it doesn't work. Alice is sad and wonders how she will ever get out of the hallway. Alice finds a door in a hall that is too small for her to fit through. She tries to open it with a key, but it does not work. She then finds a bottle on the table with a label that says \"Drink Me.\" Alice finds a bottle labeled \"Drink Me\" and decides to take a sip. She shrinks down to ten inches tall and is excited to enter the garden through the small door. Alice is worried that she might go out like a candle, and wonders what she would be like then. She tries to imagine what a candle's flame looks like after the candle is blown out, but she can't remember ever having seen such a thing.\n\nAlice decides to go into the garden, but she forgets the key and can't reach it. She gets tired and sits down to cry.\n\nAlice tells herself to stop crying and that it's no use to pretend to be two people. She thinks that there's hardly enough of her left to make one respectable person. Alice finds a cake that makes her grow larger, and she uses it to reach a key that will allow her into the garden. Alice is planning to be kind to her feet by giving them new boots for Christmas, but she finds it difficult to do so. She eventually meets the White Rabbit, who is dressed splendidly. Alice meets a rabbit who is in a hurry and drops his gloves and fan. Alice picks them up and begins talking to the rabbit, but he runs away. Alice wonders if she has been changed overnight and tries to remember who she is. Alice is confused about who she is and wonders if she has been changed into someone else. She decides that if she is indeed someone else, she would rather stay down where she is than go upstairs. Alice is surprised to find herself shrinking, and even more surprised to find herself in the sea. She wonders if she can take the train back. Alice finds herself in a pool of tears, and meets a mouse. She wonders if the mouse knows the way out, and tries to ask it in English. The mouse doesn't seem to understand, but winks at her. Alice encounters a mouse who is terrified of cats. The mouse explains that his family has always hated cats, and he doesn't want to hear their name again. Alice meets a mouse who is afraid of cats and dogs. The mouse tells Alice its story, and then they all swim to shore. The animals on the bank are trying to figure out how to dry off, and the Mouse takes charge. The Mouse explains that the best way to dry off is to listen to a story. The story is about William the Conqueror. The Mouse is telling the Duck about how the archbishop found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown. However, the Duck interrupts and does not seem to understand what the Mouse is saying. The passage describes a race in which everyone wins and Alice is chosen to give out the prizes. Alice finds a box of comfits and hands them out as prizes. The Mouse insists that Alice should have a prize too, so the Dodo presents her with a thimble. They all eat the comfits, and then the Mouse tells them his story. The Mouse tells Alice a story, but gets angry and walks away before finishing. Alice and the others beg the Mouse to come back and finish the story, but it refuses. Alice talks to a Lory and a Crab about her pet cat, Dinah. The mention of Dinah's predilection for catching and eating birds causes a stir among the other animals, who all hurry off. Alice is left alone, wondering if she will ever see her cat again. The White Rabbit is looking for his fan and gloves, and Alice tries to help. The Rabbit gets angry and tells Alice to go get them, so she runs off. Alice finds a house with a brass plate that says \"W. Rabbit\" and goes in. She finds a room with a fan and gloves and picks them up. She also finds a bottle and drinks from it. Alice drank from a magic bottle and grew until she was too large for the room. She was uncomfortable and wished she could go home. Alice is in the middle of a room with no way to escape and no room to grow. She meets a rabbit who tells her she should be learning lessons. Alice hears a Rabbit and an unknown voice arguing, followed by the sound of breaking glass. She makes a couple of attempts to grab the Rabbit, but each time only manages to break more glass. Eventually she gets fed up and wishes she could be pulled out of the window. A little animal is scratching and scrambling in the chimney close to Alice. She kicks it, and Bill falls out of the chimney. Alice encounters a group of rabbits who tell her to go away. She then finds herself in a room full of cakes, which she eats, and shrinks. Alice shrinks and runs into a crowd of animals and birds. They all attack her, but she escapes into a thick wood. She then decides her first task is to grow back to her normal size, and the second is to find the garden. While she is peering around, an enormous puppy appears and scares her. She offers it a stick and it jumps away. Alice meets a puppy and plays with it for a while, before realizing that she is too small. She wonders how she will grow up again, and decides she needs to eat or drink something. Alice meets a blue caterpillar smoking a hookah and they have a conversation. The caterpillar asks Alice who she is and Alice replies that she doesn't quite know, as she feels she has changed several times since that morning. The caterpillar tells Alice to explain herself and Alice tries, but finds she cannot because she doesn't understand it herself.

The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.  \u201cThere\u2019s certainly too much pepper in that soup!\u201d Alice said to herself, as well as she could for sneezing.

Yet some feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these rugged bosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase more characteristically, of advancement in his profession. He is an Englishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices, unsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of humanity. I first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel; finding that he was unemployed in this city, I easily engaged him to assist in my enterprise.  The master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline. This circumstance, added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, made me very desirous to engage him. A youth passed in solitude, my best years spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the groundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste to the usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never believed it to be necessary, and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services.

One or two stiff gales and the springing of a leak are accidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record, and I shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage.  Adieu, my dear Margaret. Be assured that for my own sake, as well as yours, I will not rashly encounter danger. I will be cool, persevering, and prudent.  But success _shall_ crown my endeavours. Wherefore not? Thus far I have gone, tracing a secure way over the pathless seas, the very stars themselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph. Why not still proceed over the untamed yet obedient element? What can stop the determined heart and resolved will of man?  My swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus. But I must finish. Heaven bless my beloved sister!  R.W.     Letter 4   _To Mrs. Saville, England._  August 5th, 17\u2014.  So strange an accident has happened to us that I cannot forbear recording it, although it is very probable that you will see me before these papers can come into your possession.  Last Monday (July 31st) we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed in the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which she floated. Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we were compassed round by a very thick fog. We accordingly lay to, hoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather.

We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by dogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a mile; a being which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature, sat in the sledge and guided the dogs. We watched the rapid progress of the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the distant inequalities of the ice.  This appearance excited our unqualified wonder. We were, as we believed, many hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote that it was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed. Shut in, however, by ice, it was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the greatest attention.  About two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea, and before night the ice broke and freed our ship. We, however, lay to until the morning, fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which float about after the breaking up of the ice. I profited of this time to rest for a few hours.  In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck and found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently talking to someone in the sea.

I replied that I could not answer with any degree of certainty, for the ice had not broken until near midnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety before that time; but of this I could not judge.  From this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the stranger. He manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for the sledge which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in the cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere. I have promised that someone should watch for him and give him instant notice if any new object should appear\n\nNext chunk:", "completion": " in sight.

The passage describes the author's excitement at the prospect of exploring the Arctic, which he imagines as a land of beauty and wonder. The author is discussing their motivations for embarking on a voyage to the North Pole, and how they hope to make various discoveries that will benefit all of humanity. They conclude by expressing their excitement for the journey ahead. The speaker recalls how, as a child, they were fascinated by their uncle's library of books on voyages of discovery. Despite their education being neglected, they read these books avidly and dreamed of going on such voyages themselves. These dreams faded when they discovered poetry and realized that they could have their own niche in the world of literature. However, when they inherited their cousin's fortune, they decided to pursue their earlier dream of going on a great voyage of discovery. For this, they trained their body to endure hardship and studied various sciences. The narrator is an adventurer who has decided to embark on a long and difficult journey. They are aware of the dangers involved, but feel that the rewards are worth the risks. They are confident in their abilities, but sometimes find it difficult to maintain their spirits. The passage describes the narrator's plans to sail to the Arctic in search of a new land. He laments not having a friend to share in his adventure, but is determined to go forward with his plans. The passage describes the author's feelings of loneliness and isolation, and his desire for a friend who can understand and sympathize with him. He laments his lack of education and formal training, and wishes for someone who can help him to control and focus his thoughts. This passage describes the author's lieutenant and master, both of whom are men of great character. The author first met the lieutenant on a whale vessel and was impressed by his courage and desire for glory. The author then met the master and was impressed by his kindness, courage, and respect from his crew. A man loved a young Russian woman but she was in love with someone else. He gave her to her lover and left the country. The speaker is looking forward to their upcoming voyage to unexplored regions, and is preparing to depart. They are excited and nervous about what they will find, and hope to kill no albatrosses. The speaker attributes their love of the ocean to the work of a poet. The author is on a voyage to explore unvisited regions and is writing to his sister to update her on his progress. He is in good spirits and his men are not deterred by the dangers they may encounter. He is looking forward to reaching his destination. The author describes an accident at sea and says that he hopes nothing worse will happen on the voyage. He expresses confidence that he will be successful in his endeavors. A group of sailors on a ship in the Arctic Ocean spot a man in a sledge being pulled by dogs. They watch him for a while, but he eventually disappears into the distance. Later, they hear the sound of the ice breaking and realize that their ship is now free. However, they remain cautious and stay put for the night. In the morning, they see that there is indeed a sledge and a man in the water next to their ship. A man is rescued from an ice floe by a passing ship. He is European, not a savage, and is surprised to learn that the ship is bound for the northern pole. He is in a terrible state, but is revived and brought into the ship. A man is found near death on the ice, and is revived by brandy and soup. He is taken to the speaker's cabin to recover, and the speaker notes that he is generally melancholy and sometimes seems mad.

The narrator has found a stranger on a ship who appears to be ill. The stranger gradually improves, but is very quiet and seems uneasy around others. The narrator begins to feel compassion and affection for the stranger. The speaker is talking to someone else about their shared interest in a project, and how excited they are about it.

The other person then says they will share their story, which the speaker is very curious to hear. The passage describes a conversation between two people, in which the stranger confides in the narrator about his sorrowful past. The stranger expresses his belief that everyone deserves to have a friend, and the narrator agrees. The stranger then goes on to say that he once had a friend who was the most noble of creatures, but he has since lost everything and feels hopeless. The stranger is moved by the beauty of nature, even though he is broken in spirit. The passage describes a man who is able to rise above his suffering and misery, and who has an extraordinary ability to judge and understand the causes of things.

As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot refrain from relating them. One of his most intimate friends was a merchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous mischances, into poverty. This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for his rank and magnificence. Having paid his debts, therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in wretchedness. My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances.

A group of sailors on a ship in the Arctic Ocean spot a man in a sledge being pulled by dogs. They watch him for a while, but he eventually disappears into the distance. Later, they hear the sound of the ice breaking and realize that their ship is now free. However, they remain cautious and stay put for the night. In the morning, they see that there is indeed a sledge and a man in the water next to their ship. A man is rescued from an ice floe by a passing ship. He is European, not a savage, and is surprised to learn that the ship is bound for the northern pole. He is in a terrible state, but is revived and brought into the ship.

As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot refrain from relating them. One of his most intimate friends was a merchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous mischances, into poverty. This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for his rank and magnificence. Having paid his debts, therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in wretchedness.

They conclude by expressing their excitement for the journey ahead. The speaker recalls how, as a child, they were fascinated by their uncle's library of books on voyages of discovery. Despite their education being neglected, they read these books avidly and dreamed of going on such voyages themselves. These dreams faded when they discovered poetry and realized that they could have their own niche in the world of literature. However, when they inherited their cousin's fortune, they decided to pursue their earlier dream of going on a great voyage of discovery. For this, they trained their body to endure hardship and studied various sciences. The narrator is an adventurer who has decided to embark on a long and difficult journey. They are aware of the dangers involved, but feel that the rewards are worth the risks. They are confident in their abilities, but sometimes find it difficult to maintain their spirits.

A group of sailors on a ship in the Arctic Ocean spot a man in a sledge being pulled by dogs. They watch him for a while, but he eventually disappears into the distance. Later, they hear the sound of the ice breaking and realize that their ship is now free. However, they remain cautious and stay put for the night. In the morning, they see that there is indeed a sledge and a man in the water next to their ship. A man is rescued from an ice floe by a passing ship. He is European, not a savage, and is surprised to learn that the ship is bound for the northern pole. He is in a terrible state, but is revived and brought into the ship. A man is found near death on the ice, and is revived by brandy and soup. He is taken to the speaker's cabin to recover, and the speaker notes that he is generally melancholy and sometimes seems mad.

Despite all this, the man is still waiting for one more event before he can rest in peace. The narrator's ancestor was a Genevese counsellor and syndic, and his father was respected for his integrity and public service. The narrator is to record his grandfather's story, which is sure to be strange and harrowing. My father's friend, Beaufort, became poor and moved to Lucerne. My father found him and they had a heart-to-heart about Beaufort's false pride. The passage describes Caroline Beaufort's difficult life after her father's death.

No human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself. My parents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence. We felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to their caprice, but the agents and creators of all the many delights which we enjoyed. When I mingled with other families I distinctly discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted the development of filial love.

I confess that neither the structure of languages, nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states possessed attractions for me. It was the secrets of heaven and earth that I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance of things or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man that occupied me, still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical, or in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.  Meanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral relations of things. The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes, and the actions of men were his theme; and his hope and his dream was to become one among those whose names are recorded in story\n\nNext chunk:", "completion": " as the gallant and adventurous benefactors of our species.

A new light seemed to dawn upon my mind, and bounding with joy, I communicated my discovery to my father. My father looked carelessly at the title page of my book and said, \u201cAh! Cornelius Agrippa! My dear Victor, do not waste your time upon this; it is sad trash.\u201d  If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to me that the principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a modern system of science had been introduced which possessed much greater powers than the ancient, because the powers of the latter were chimerical, while those of the former were real and practical, under such circumstances I should certainly have thrown Agrippa aside and have contented my imagination, warmed as it was, by returning with greater ardour to my former studies.

The passage describes the author's excitement at the prospect of exploring the Arctic, which he imagines as a land of beauty and wonder. The author is discussing their motivations for embarking on a voyage to the North Pole, and how they hope to make various discoveries that will benefit all of humanity. They conclude by expressing their excitement for the journey ahead. The speaker recalls how, as a child, they were fascinated by their uncle's library of books on voyages of discovery. Despite their education being neglected, they read these books avidly and dreamed of going on such voyages themselves. These dreams faded when they discovered poetry and realized that they could have their own niche in the world of literature. However, when they inherited their cousin's fortune, they decided to pursue their earlier dream of going on a great voyage of discovery. For this, they trained their body to endure hardship and studied various sciences. The narrator is an adventurer who has decided to embark on a long and difficult journey. They are aware of the dangers involved, but feel that the rewards are worth the risks. They are confident in their abilities, but sometimes find it difficult to maintain their spirits. The passage describes the narrator's plans to sail to the Arctic in search of a new land. He laments not having a friend to share in his adventure, but is determined to go forward with his plans. The passage describes the author's feelings of loneliness and isolation, and his desire for a friend who can understand and sympathize with him. He laments his lack of education and formal training, and wishes for someone who can help him to control and focus his thoughts. This passage describes the author's lieutenant and master, both of whom are men of great character. The author first met the lieutenant on a whale vessel and was impressed by his courage and desire for glory. The author then met the master and was impressed by his kindness, courage, and respect from his crew. A man loved a young Russian woman but she was in love with someone else. He gave her to her lover and left the country. The speaker is looking forward to their upcoming voyage to unexplored regions, and is preparing to depart. They are excited and nervous about what they will find, and hope to kill no albatrosses. The speaker attributes their love of the ocean to the work of a poet. The author is on a voyage to explore unvisited regions and is writing to his sister to update her on his progress. He is in good spirits and his men are not deterred by the dangers they may encounter. He is looking forward to reaching his destination. The author describes an accident at sea and says that he hopes nothing worse will happen on the voyage. He expresses confidence that he will be successful in his endeavors. A group of sailors on a ship in the Arctic Ocean spot a man in a sledge being pulled by dogs. They watch him for a while, but he eventually disappears into the distance. Later, they hear the sound of the ice breaking and realize that their ship is now free. However, they remain cautious and stay put for the night. In the morning, they see that there is indeed a sledge and a man in the water next to their ship. A man is rescued from an ice floe by a passing ship. He is European, not a savage, and is surprised to learn that the ship is bound for the northern pole. He is in a terrible state, but is revived and brought into the ship. A man is found near death on the ice, and is revived by brandy and soup. He is taken to the speaker's cabin to recover, and the speaker notes that he is generally melancholy and sometimes seems mad. The lieutenant asks him why he came so far on the ice, and he replies that he is seeking someone who fled from him. The stranger is excited by the prospect of seeing the other sledge again, but is too weak to be on deck. The narrator has promised to keep watch for him. The narrator has found a stranger on a ship who appears to be ill. The stranger gradually improves, but is very quiet and seems uneasy around others. The narrator begins to feel compassion and affection for the stranger. The speaker is talking to someone else about their shared interest in a project, and how excited they are about it. The other person suddenly becomes very emotional, and the speaker wonders if they are also \"mad\" with excitement. The other person then says they will share their story, which the speaker is very curious to hear. The passage describes a conversation between two people, in which the stranger confides in the narrator about his sorrowful past. The stranger expresses his belief that everyone deserves to have a friend, and the narrator agrees. The stranger then goes on to say that he once had a friend who was the most noble of creatures, but he has since lost everything and feels hopeless. The stranger is moved by the beauty of nature, even though he is broken in spirit. The passage describes a man who is able to rise above his suffering and misery, and who has an extraordinary ability to judge and understand the causes of things. The speaker admires this man greatly and yesterday the man confided in the speaker, telling him of his own misfortunes and how they have changed his outlook on life. The narrator is happy to hear that the man wants to tell his story, but doesn't want to hear it because it will just make the man relive his pain. The man tells the story anyway, saying that it might help the narrator if he is in a similar situation. The story is about how the man got to his current state, which is full of hardships. Despite all this, the man is still waiting for one more event before he can rest in peace. The narrator's ancestor was a Genevese counsellor and syndic, and his father was respected for his integrity and public service. The narrator is to record his grandfather's story, which is sure to be strange and harrowing. My father's friend, Beaufort, became poor and moved to Lucerne. My father found him and they had a heart-to-heart about Beaufort's false pride. The passage describes Caroline Beaufort's difficult life after her father's death. She was left with no money and had to find work to support herself. When her father died, she was overcome with grief, but was soon taken in by a relative. Two years later, she married the man who would become the narrator's father. This passage describes the deep affection between the author's parents, which was strengthened by their shared sense of justice. The father was especially grateful to the mother for her many virtues, and went out of his way to make her life comfortable and pleasurable. The couple traveled to Italy, Germany, and France after getting married, in part to help the mother recover from some health issues. The author's parents were very loving and devoted to him, and he remembers them fondly. He was their only child for many years. His mother especially desired to have a daughter, but they never had any more children. This passage tells the story of a poor child who is different from the other children in her poverty-stricken village. She is thin and fair, with bright golden hair, and is so beautiful that she seems otherworldly. The peasant woman who is caring for her reveals that she is actually the daughter of a Milanese nobleman, and was left with them to nurse. The passage tells the story of a young Italian girl who is orphaned and taken in by a wealthy family. The girl is very beautiful, and everyone loves her. The speaker and Elizabeth were childhood friends who were brought up together. They had a close relationship and Harmony was the soul of their companionship. Elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated disposition, while the speaker was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge. The passage describes the author's early love of nature and fascination with its secrets. It also mentions his close friendship with Henry Clerval, with whom he shared a love of adventure and imagination.

He was interested in the secrets of the world, both physical and metaphysical. Clerval was interested in the morality of human actions. The passage describes the narrator's happy childhood, during which their sister Elizabeth was a shining light in the family. The narrator reflects on how Elizabeth's kindness and goodness inspired them and their friend Clerval to be better people. However, the narrator's idyllic childhood was eventually shattered by misfortune. The narrator's father tells him not to waste his time on the works of Cornelius Agrippa, but the narrator is enthusiastic about the book and believes it contains great secrets. The narrator describes their love of reading, particularly of wild and fanciful authors. They lament the lack of progress made by philosophers in understanding the natural world, and express their desire to uncover its secrets.\n\nLast chunk: taken of my volume by no means assured me that he was acquainted with its contents, and I continued to read with the greatest avidity.

However, the narrator is discouraged from pursuing his studies after the man's theories overthrow his previous beliefs.\n\nLast chunk: accident again changed the current of my ideas.  When I was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near Belrive, when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm. It advanced from behind the mountains of Jura, and the thunder burst at once with frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens. I remained, while the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight. As I stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue from an old and beautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from our house; and so soon as the dazzling light vanished, the oak had disappeared, and nothing remained but a blasted stump. When we visited it the next morning, we found the tree shattered in a singular manner. It was not splintered by the shock, but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood. I never beheld anything so utterly destroyed.  Before this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of electricity. On this occasion a man of great research in natural philosophy was with us, and excited by this catastrophe, he entered on the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of electricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to me. All that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa, Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my accustomed studies.

I had hitherto attended the schools of Geneva, but my father thought it necessary for the completion of my education that I should be made acquainted with other customs than those of my native country. My departure was therefore fixed at an early date, but before the day resolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life occurred\u2014an omen, as it were, of my future misery.  Elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; her illness was severe, and she was in the greatest danger. During her illness many arguments had been urged to persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her. She had at first yielded to our entreaties, but when she heard that the life of her favourite was menaced, she could no longer control her anxiety. She attended her sickbed; her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity of the distemper\u2014Elizabeth was saved, but the consequences of this imprudence were fatal to her preserver. On the third day my mother sickened; her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms, and the looks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event. On her deathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not desert her. She joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself. \u201cMy children,\u201d she said, \u201cmy firmest hopes of future happiness were placed on the prospect of your union. This expectation will now be the consolation of your father. Elizabeth, my love, you must supply\n\nNext chunk:", "completion": " my place to my younger children. Alas!

But these are not thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to death and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world.\u201d  She died calmly, and her countenance expressed affection even in death. I need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent by that most irreparable evil, the void that presents itself to the soul, and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance.

These are the reflections of the first days; but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the evil, then the actual bitterness of grief commences. Yet from whom has not that rude hand rent away some dear connection? And why should I describe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel? The time at length arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; and the smile that plays upon the lips, although it may be deemed a sacrilege, is not banished.

The passage describes the author's excitement at the prospect of exploring the Arctic, which he imagines as a land of beauty and wonder. The author is discussing their motivations for embarking on a voyage to the North Pole, and how they hope to make various discoveries that will benefit all of humanity. They conclude by expressing their excitement for the journey ahead. The speaker recalls how, as a child, they were fascinated by their uncle's library of books on voyages of discovery. Despite their education being neglected, they read these books avidly and dreamed of going on such voyages themselves. These dreams faded when they discovered poetry and realized that they could have their own niche in the world of literature. However, when they inherited their cousin's fortune, they decided to pursue their earlier dream of going on a great voyage of discovery. For this, they trained their body to endure hardship and studied various sciences. The narrator is an adventurer who has decided to embark on a long and difficult journey. They are aware of the dangers involved, but feel that the rewards are worth the risks. They are confident in their abilities, but sometimes find it difficult to maintain their spirits.

This passage describes the author's lieutenant and master, both of whom are men of great character. The author first met the lieutenant on a whale vessel and was impressed by his courage and desire for glory. The author then met the master and was impressed by his kindness, courage, and respect from his crew. A man loved a young Russian woman but she was in love with someone else. He gave her to her lover and left the country. The speaker is looking forward to their upcoming voyage to unexplored regions, and is preparing to depart. They are excited and nervous about what they will find, and hope to kill no albatrosses. The speaker attributes their love of the ocean to the work of a poet. The author is on a voyage to explore unvisited regions and is writing to his sister to update her on his progress. He is in good spirits and his men are not deterred by the dangers they may encounter. He is looking forward to reaching his destination. The author describes an accident at sea and says that he hopes nothing worse will happen on the voyage. He expresses confidence that he will be successful in his endeavors. A group of sailors on a ship in the Arctic Ocean spot a man in a sledge being pulled by dogs. They watch him for a while, but he eventually disappears into the distance. Later, they hear the sound of the ice breaking and realize that their ship is now free. However, they remain cautious and stay put for the night. In the morning, they see that there is indeed a sledge and a man in the water next to their ship. A man is rescued from an ice floe by a passing ship. He is European, not a savage, and is surprised to learn that the ship is bound for the northern pole. He is in a terrible state, but is revived and brought into the ship. A man is found near death on the ice, and is revived by brandy and soup. He is taken to the speaker's cabin to recover, and the speaker notes that he is generally melancholy and sometimes seems mad. The lieutenant asks him why he came so far on the ice, and he replies that he is seeking someone who fled from him. The stranger is excited by the prospect of seeing the other sledge again, but is too weak to be on deck. The narrator has promised to keep watch for him. The narrator has found a stranger on a ship who appears to be ill. The stranger gradually improves, but is very quiet and seems uneasy around others. The narrator begins to feel compassion and affection for the stranger. The speaker is talking to someone else about their shared interest in a project, and how excited they are about it. The other person suddenly becomes very emotional, and the speaker wonders if they are also \"mad\" with excitement. The other person then says they will share their story, which the speaker is very curious to hear. The passage describes a conversation between two people, in which the stranger confides in the narrator about his sorrowful past. The stranger expresses his belief that everyone deserves to have a friend, and the narrator agrees. The stranger then goes on to say that he once had a friend who was the most noble of creatures, but he has since lost everything and feels hopeless. The stranger is moved by the beauty of nature, even though he is broken in spirit. The passage describes a man who is able to rise above his suffering and misery, and who has an extraordinary ability to judge and understand the causes of things. The speaker admires this man greatly and yesterday the man confided in the speaker, telling him of his own misfortunes and how they have changed his outlook on life. The narrator is happy to hear that the man wants to tell his story, but doesn't want to hear it because it will just make the man relive his pain. The man tells the story anyway, saying that it might help the narrator if he is in a similar situation. The story is about how the man got to his current state, which is full of hardships. Despite all this, the man is still waiting for one more event before he can rest in peace. The narrator's ancestor was a Genevese counsellor and syndic, and his father was respected for his integrity and public service. The narrator is to record his grandfather's story, which is sure to be strange and harrowing. My father's friend, Beaufort, became poor and moved to Lucerne. My father found him and they had a heart-to-heart about Beaufort's false pride. The passage describes Caroline Beaufort's difficult life after her father's death. She was left with no money and had to find work to support herself. When her father died, she was overcome with grief, but was soon taken in by a relative. Two years later, she married the man who would become the narrator's father. This passage describes the deep affection between the author's parents, which was strengthened by their shared sense of justice.

The author's parents were very loving and devoted to him, and he remembers them fondly. He was their only child for many years. His mother especially desired to have a daughter, but they never had any more children. This passage tells the story of a poor child who is different from the other children in her poverty-stricken village. She is thin and fair, with bright golden hair, and is so beautiful that she seems otherworldly. The peasant woman who is caring for her reveals that she is actually the daughter of a Milanese nobleman, and was left with them to nurse. The passage tells the story of a young Italian girl who is orphaned and taken in by a wealthy family. The girl is very beautiful, and everyone loves her.

The passage describes the author's early love of nature and fascination with its secrets. It also mentions his close friendship with Henry Clerval, with whom he shared a love of adventure and imagination.

He was interested in the secrets of the world, both physical and metaphysical. Clerval was interested in the morality of human actions. The passage describes the narrator's happy childhood, during which their sister Elizabeth was a shining light in the family. The narrator reflects on how Elizabeth's kindness and goodness inspired them and their friend Clerval to be better people. However, the narrator's idyllic childhood was eventually shattered by misfortune. The narrator's father tells him not to waste his time on the works of Cornelius Agrippa, but the narrator is enthusiastic about the book and believes it contains great secrets. The narrator describes their love of reading, particularly of wild and fanciful authors. They lament the lack of progress made by philosophers in understanding the natural world, and express their desire to uncover its secrets.

At fifteen, the narrator witnesses a violent thunderstorm and sees a tree reduced to splinters by a stream of fire. A man of great research in natural philosophy explains his theory of electricity and galvanism, which fascinates the narrator. However, the narrator is discouraged from pursuing his studies after the man's theories overthrow his previous beliefs. The narrator gives up their former interests and takes up mathematics after a change in mood. They attribute this change to the intervention of a guardian angel, and find happiness in their new studies. However, Destiny has other plans, and the narrator is ultimately destroyed.

The lawn started at the beach and ran towards the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over sundials and brick walks and burning gardens\u2014finally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run. The front was broken by a line of French windows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm windy afternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front porch.  He had changed since his New Haven years. Now he was a sturdy straw-haired man of thirty, with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner. Two shining arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward.

However, they admit that there are still some people they just can't see eye to eye with.

He had to polish it from morning till night, until finally it began to affect his nose\u2014\u201d  \u201cThings went from bad to worse,\u201d suggested Miss Baker.  \u201cYes. Things went from bad to worse, until finally he had to give up his position.\u201d  For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I listened\u2014then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.  The butler came back and murmured something close to Tom\u2019s ear, whereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair, and without a word went inside.

Tom Buchanan's mistress lived in a small, yellow brick building on the edge of a waste land. One afternoon, Tom took his friend to meet her.

She tells the driver that she wants to buy a dog, and he takes them to a man selling puppies. They pick out an Airedale.\n\nLast chunk: sensibilities of those East Eggers who might be on the train.  She had changed her dress to a brown figured muslin, which stretched tight over her rather wide hips as Tom helped her to the platform in New York. At the newsstand she bought a copy of Town Tattle and a moving-picture magazine, and in the station drugstore some cold cream and a small flask of perfume. Upstairs, in the solemn echoing drive she let four taxicabs drive away before she selected a new one, lavender-coloured with grey upholstery, and in this we slid out from the mass of the station into the glowing sunshine. But immediately she turned sharply from the window and, leaning forward, tapped on the front glass.  \u201cI want to get one of those dogs,\u201d she said earnestly. \u201cI want to get one for the apartment. They\u2019re nice to have\u2014a dog.\u201d  We backed up to a grey old man who bore an absurd resemblance to John D. Rockefeller. In a basket swung from his neck cowered a dozen very recent puppies of an indeterminate breed.  \u201cWhat kind are they?\u201d asked Mrs. Wilson eagerly, as he came to the taxi-window.  \u201cAll kinds. What kind do you want, lady?\u201d  \u201cI\u2019d like to get one of those police dogs; I don\u2019t suppose you got that kind?\u201d  The man peered doubtfully into the basket, plunged in his hand and drew one up, wriggling, by the back of the neck.  \u201cThat\u2019s no police dog,\u201d said Tom.  \u201cNo, it\u2019s not exactly a police dog,\u201d said the man with disappointment in his voice. \u201cIt\u2019s more of an Airedale.\u201d He passed his hand over the brown\n\nNext chunk:", "completion": " washrag of a back. \u201cLook at that coat.

Looked at from a distance, however, the hen resolved itself into a bonnet, and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down into the room. Several old copies of Town Tattle lay on the table together with a copy of Simon Called Peter, and some of the small scandal magazines of Broadway. Mrs. Wilson was first concerned with the dog.

Mr. McKee regarded her intently with his head on one side, and then moved his hand back and forth slowly in front of his face.  I should change the light, he said after a moment.

If Chester could only get you in that pose I think he could make something of it.

Mr. McKee regarded her intently with his head on one side, and then moved his hand back and forth slowly in front of his face.  I should change the light, he said after a moment. Id like to bring out the modelling of the features. And Id try to get hold of all the back hair.  I wouldnt think of changing the light, cried Mrs. McKee. I think its  Her husband said Sh! and we all looked at the subject again, whereupon Tom Buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet.  You McKees have something to drink, he said. Get some more ice and mineral water, Myrtle, before everybody goes to sleep.  I told that boy about the ice. Myrtle raised her eyebrows in despair at the shiftlessness of the lower orders. These people! You have to keep after them all the time.  She looked at me and laughed pointlessly.

She lowered her voice again. \u201cIt\u2019s really his wife that\u2019s keeping them apart. She\u2019s a Catholic, and they don\u2019t believe in divorce.\u201d  Daisy was not a Catholic, and I was a little shocked at the elaborateness of the lie.  \u201cWhen they do get married,\u201d continued Catherine, \u201cthey\u2019re going West to live for a while until it blows over.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019d be more discreet to go to Europe.\u201d  \u201cOh, do you like Europe?\u201d she exclaimed surprisingly. \u201cI just got back from Monte Carlo.\u201d  \u201cReally.\u201d  \u201cJust last year.

We had over twelve hundred dollars when we started, but we got gyped out of it all in two days in the private rooms. We had an awful time getting back, I can tell you. God, how I hated that town!\u201d  The late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a moment like the blue honey of the Mediterranean\u2014then the shrill voice of Mrs. McKee called me back into the room.  \u201cI almost made a mistake, too,\u201d she declared vigorously. \u201cI almost married a little kike who\u2019d been after me for years. I knew he was below me. Everybody kept saying to me: \u2018Lucille, that man\u2019s way below you!\u2019 But if I hadn\u2019t met Chester, he\u2019d of got me sure.\u201d  \u201cYes,\n\nNext chunk:", "completion": " but listen,\u201d said Myrtle Wilson, nodding her head up and down, \u201cat least you didn\u2019t marry him.\u201d  \u201cI know I didn\u2019t.\u201d  \u201cWell, I married him,\u201d said Myrtle, ambiguously. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the difference between your case and mine.\u201d  \u201cWhy did you, Myrtle?\u201d demanded Catherine. \u201cNobody forced you to.\u201d  Myrtle considered.  \u201cI married him because I thought he was a gentleman,\u201d she said finally. \u201cI thought he knew something about breeding, but he wasn\u2019t fit to lick my shoe.\u201d  \u201cYou were crazy about him for a while,\u201d said Catherine.  \u201cCrazy about him!\u201d cried Myrtle incredulously. \u201cWho said I was crazy about him?

But above the grey land and the drifting dust, you can see the blue and gigantic eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg. Tom Buchanan's mistress lived in a small, yellow brick building on the edge of a waste land. One afternoon, Tom took his friend to meet her. The friend was not interested in meeting her, but Tom was insistent. The building contained three shops, one of which was for rent. George B. Wilson is the owner of a struggling garage. When Tom and the narrator enter, Wilson seems hopeful that they will buy a car. Tom is unimpressed by the garage and tells Wilson that he may take his business elsewhere.

If Chester could only get you in that pose I think he could make something of it.  We all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson, who removed a strand of hair from over her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile. Mr. McKee regarded her intently with his head on one side, and then moved his hand back and forth slowly in front of his face.  I should change the light, he said after a moment. Id like to bring out the modelling of the features. And Id try to get hold of all the back hair.  I wouldnt think of changing the light, cried Mrs. McKee. I think its  Her husband said Sh! and we all looked at the subject again, whereupon Tom Buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet.  You McKees have something to drink, he said. Get some more ice and mineral water, Myrtle, before everybody goes to sleep.  I told that boy about the ice. Myrtle raised her eyebrows in despair at the shiftlessness of the lower orders. These people! You have to keep after them all the time.  She looked at me and laughed pointlessly. Then she flounced over to the dog, kissed it with ecstasy, and swept into the kitchen, implying that a dozen chefs awaited her orders there.  Ive done some nice things out on Long Island, asserted Mr. McKee.  Tom looked at him blankly.  Two of them we have framed downstairs.  Two what? demanded Tom.  Two studies. One of them I call Montauk PointThe Gulls, and the other I call Montauk PointThe Sea.  The sister Catherine The passage describes a conversation between two women, one of whom is married to a man named George B. Wilson. The first woman says that she is scared of her neighbor, who is a wealthy man named Gatsbys. The second woman says that she does not understand why people stay married to someone if they cannot stand them. Catherine tells Daisy that she should divorce Wilson and marry her instead, because Daisy's wife is a Catholic and doesn't believe in divorce. Daisy is shocked by the lie, but Catherine continues, saying that they would have to go West to live for a while until the scandal blows over. Mrs. McKee interrupts to tell her own story of almost marrying a man beneath her. Myrtle Wilson is unhappy in her marriage and regrets ever marrying her husband. She says she only married him because she thought he was a gentleman, but he has turned out to be anything but.

I wanted to get out and walk eastward toward the park through the soft twilight, but each time I tried to go I became entangled in some wild, strident argument which pulled me back, as if with ropes, into my chair. Yet high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening streets, and I saw him too, looking up and wondering. I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.  Myrtle pulled her chair close to mine, and suddenly her warm breath poured over me the story of her first meeting with Tom.  \u201cIt was on the two little seats facing each other that are always the last ones left on the train. I was going up to New York to see my sister and spend the night. He had on a dress suit and patent leather shoes, and I couldn\u2019t keep my eyes off him, but every time he looked at me I had to pretend to be looking at the advertisement over his head. When we came into the station he was next to me, and his white shirtfront pressed against my arm, and so I told him I\u2019d have to call a policeman, but he knew I lied. I was so excited that when I got into a taxi with him I didn\u2019t hardly know I wasn\u2019t getting into a subway train. All I kept thinking about, over and over, was \u2018You can\u2019t live forever; you can\u2019t live forever.\u2019\u200a\u201d  She turned to Mrs. McKee and the\n\nNext chunk:", "completion": " room rang full of her artificial laughter.  \u201cMy dear,\u201d she cried, \u201cI\u2019m going to give you this dress as soon as I\u2019m through with it.

A massage and a wave, and a collar for the dog, and one of those cute little ashtrays where you touch a spring, and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother\u2019s grave that\u2019ll last all summer.

Taking out my handkerchief I wiped from his cheek the spot of dried lather that had worried me all the afternoon.  The little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind eyes through the smoke, and from time to time groaning faintly. People disappeared, reappeared, made plans to go somewhere, and then lost each other, searched for each other, found each other a few feet away. Some time toward midnight Tom Buchanan and Mrs. Wilson stood face to face discussing, in impassioned voices, whether Mrs. Wilson had any right to mention Daisy\u2019s name.  \u201cDaisy! Daisy! Daisy!\u201d shouted Mrs. Wilson. \u201cI\u2019ll say it whenever I want to! Daisy! Dai\u2014\u201d  Making a short deft movement, Tom Buchanan broke her nose with his open hand.

Tom Buchanan's mistress lived in a small, yellow brick building on the edge of a waste land. One afternoon, Tom took his friend to meet her. The friend was not interested in meeting her, but Tom was insistent. The building contained three shops, one of which was for rent. George B. Wilson is the owner of a struggling garage. When Tom and the narrator enter, Wilson seems hopeful that they will buy a car. Tom is unimpressed by the garage and tells Wilson that he may take his business elsewhere. Wilson's wife then appears and Tom is immediately struck by her sensual beauty. Tom Buchanan and his girlfriend go to New York to meet up with Nick Carraway, who is Mrs. Wilson's sister's husband. Mrs. Wilson accompanies them in a separate car. Mrs. Wilson changes her dress and buys a few things before getting into a taxi. She tells the driver that she wants to buy a dog, and he takes them to a man selling puppies. They pick out an Airedale. Tom and Mrs. Wilson drive to Fifth Avenue, where they buy an Airedale for ten dollars. They then go to the Wilson's apartment, where Mrs. Wilson plans to have a party. The narrator goes to visit their friend Tom and his wife Mrs. Wilson. They live in a small apartment on the top floor with a lot of furniture and a big photograph of an old lady.

Tom and Myrtle reappear after disappearing for a while, and company starts to arrive at their apartment. Catherine is a slender woman with red hair, and Mr. McKee is a photographer.

She is now much louder and more assertive than before. Mrs. McKee compliments her dress and Mrs. Wilson dismisses it. Mrs. McKee is being pursued by Mr. McKee. If Chester could only get you in that pose I think he could make something of it.  We all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson, who removed a strand of hair from over her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile. Mr. McKee regarded her intently with his head on one side, and then moved his hand back and forth slowly in front of his face.  I should change the light, he said after a moment. Id like to bring out the modelling of the features. And Id try to get hold of all the back hair.  I wouldnt think of changing the light, cried Mrs. McKee. I think its  Her husband said Sh! and we all looked at the subject again, whereupon Tom Buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet.  You McKees have something to drink, he said. Get some more ice and mineral water, Myrtle, before everybody goes to sleep.  I told that boy about the ice. Myrtle raised her eyebrows in despair at the shiftlessness of the lower orders. These people! You have to keep after them all the time.  She looked at me and laughed pointlessly. Then she flounced over to the dog, kissed it with ecstasy, and swept into the kitchen, implying that a dozen chefs awaited her orders there.  Ive done some nice things out on Long Island, asserted Mr. McKee.  Tom looked at him blankly.  Two of them we have framed downstairs.  Two what? demanded Tom.  Two studies. One of them I call Montauk PointThe Gulls, and the other I call Montauk PointThe Sea.  The sister Catherine The passage describes a conversation between two women, one of whom is married to a man named George B. Wilson. The first woman says that she is scared of her neighbor, who is a wealthy man named Gatsbys. The second woman says that she does not understand why people stay married to someone if they cannot stand them. Catherine tells Daisy that she should divorce Wilson and marry her instead, because Daisy's wife is a Catholic and doesn't believe in divorce. Daisy is shocked by the lie, but Catherine continues, saying that they would have to go West to live for a while until the scandal blows over. Mrs. McKee interrupts to tell her own story of almost marrying a man beneath her. Myrtle Wilson is unhappy in her marriage and regrets ever marrying her husband. She says she only married him because she thought he was a gentleman, but he has turned out to be anything but. Myrtle's husband has been having an affair with Catherine's husband, Tom, and Myrtle says she is the first sweetie he's ever had.

They have some drinks and then Mrs. Wilson starts making phone calls. The narrator goes to buy cigarettes and comes back to find Tom and Mrs. Wilson passed out. Tom and Myrtle reappear after disappearing for a while, and company starts to arrive at their apartment. Catherine is a slender woman with red hair, and Mr. McKee is a photographer. Mrs. Wilson is a woman who is very proud of her husband's photographic work. She has recently changed her outfit to a cream-coloured dress and her personality has changed as well. She is now much louder and more assertive than before. Mrs. McKee compliments her dress and Mrs. Wilson dismisses it. Mrs. McKee is being pursued by Mr. McKee. If Chester could only get you in that pose I think he could make something of it.  We all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson, who removed a strand of hair from over her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile. Mr. McKee regarded her intently with his head on one side, and then moved his hand back and forth slowly in front of his face.  I should change the light, he said after a moment. Id like to bring out the modelling of the features. And Id try to get hold of all the back hair.  I wouldnt think of changing the light, cried Mrs. McKee. I think its  Her husband said Sh! and we all looked at the subject again, whereupon Tom Buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet.  You McKees have something to drink, he said. Get some more ice and mineral water, Myrtle, before everybody goes to sleep.  I told that boy about the ice. Myrtle raised her eyebrows in despair at the shiftlessness of the lower orders. These people! You have to keep after them all the time.  She looked at me and laughed pointlessly. Then she flounced over to the dog, kissed it with ecstasy, and swept into the kitchen, implying that a dozen chefs awaited her orders there.  Ive done some nice things out on Long Island, asserted Mr. McKee.  Tom looked at him blankly.  Two of them we have framed downstairs.  Two what? demanded Tom.  Two studies. One of them I call Montauk PointThe Gulls, and the other I call Montauk PointThe Sea.  The sister Catherine The passage describes a conversation between two women, one of whom is married to a man named George B. Wilson. The first woman says that she is scared of her neighbor, who is a wealthy man named Gatsbys. The second woman says that she does not understand why people stay married to someone if they cannot stand them. Catherine tells Daisy that she should divorce Wilson and marry her instead, because Daisy's wife is a Catholic and doesn't believe in divorce. Daisy is shocked by the lie, but Catherine continues, saying that they would have to go West to live for a while until the scandal blows over. Mrs. McKee interrupts to tell her own story of almost marrying a man beneath her. Myrtle Wilson is unhappy in her marriage and regrets ever marrying her husband. She says she only married him because she thought he was a gentleman, but he has turned out to be anything but. Myrtle's husband has been having an affair with Catherine's husband, Tom, and Myrtle says she is the first sweetie he's ever had. The passage describes the narrator's feelings of being both inside and outside of the conversations going on around him. He is pulled back into his chair by the argument, but he sees someone else looking up at the building. Myrtle tells the story of her first meeting with Tom. The passage describes a party where people are milling around, talking, and enjoying themselves. However, one woman's laughter is artificial, and she makes plans to buy new things tomorrow. Mr. McKee falls asleep, and the little dog is sitting on the table looking through the smoke. Tom Buchanan and Mrs. Wilson get into a discussion and he ends up breaking her nose. A man is sitting in his bed, looking at a portfolio of paintings. He then falls asleep and has a dream in which he is at a party at his neighbor's house. In the morning, he wakes up and catches a train. Gatsby's parties are legendary, with huge crowds, elaborate food, and lots of alcohol. A big machine in the kitchen can quickly juice 200 oranges. The parties are often so rowdy that the house requires significant repairs afterwards. The passage describes a party where the guests are enjoying themselves and socializing.\n\nLast chunk: orchestra has arrived, no thin five-piece affair, but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and cornets and piccolos, and low and high drums. The last swimmers have come in from the beach now and are dressing upstairs; the cars from New York are parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls and salons and verandas are gaudy with primary colours, and hair bobbed in strange new ways, and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile. The bar is in full swing, and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside, until the air is alive with chatter and laughter, and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot, and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other\u2019s names.  The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun, and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music, and the opera of voices pitches a key higher. Laughter is easier minute by minute, spilled with prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word. The groups change more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the same breath; already there are wanderers, confident girls who weave here and there among the stouter and more stable, become for a sharp, joyous moment the centre of a group, and then, excited with triumph, glide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and colour under the constantly changing light.  Suddenly one of these gypsies, in trembling opal, seizes a cocktail out of the air, dumps it down for courage and,\n\nNext chunk:", "completion": " moving her hands like Frisco, dances out alone on the canvas platform.

The passage describes Mr. Bennet's reaction to his wife's suggestion that they visit Mr. Bingley, a wealthy single man who is moving into the neighborhood. Mr. Bennet is not interested in meeting Mr. Bingley, but his wife insists that they do so. Mr. Bennet is over scrupulous and is preventing Mr. Bingley from marrying one of his daughters. He is concerned that they are all silly and ignorant, but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters. Mr. Bennet is an odd mixture of quick wit, sarcasm, and caprice, something his wife has not been able to understand fully after 23 years. Mrs. Bennet is a woman of low intelligence and bad temper. Their main goal in life is to get their daughters married off. When Mr. Bennet unexpectedly announces he is going to visit Mr. Bingley, Elizabeth is the only one who knows why. The passage discusses Mr. Bingley and whether or not he will be introduced to Mrs. Long.

The girls' father will take it upon himself to decline Mr. Bingley's acquaintance after Mrs. Bennet declares she is sick of him.\n\nLast chunk: somebody else       will; and after all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their       chance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness,       if you decline the office, I will take it on myself.\u201d        The girls stared at their father.

The girls grieved over such a number of       ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing,       that instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from       London, his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered       the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether; Mr.       Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another       young man.        Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant       countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine       women, with an air of decided fashion.

The passage describes Mr. Bennet's reaction to his wife's suggestion that they visit Mr. Bingley, a wealthy single man who is moving into the neighborhood. Mr. Bennet is not interested in meeting Mr. Bingley, but his wife insists that they do so. Mr. Bennet is over scrupulous and is preventing Mr. Bingley from marrying one of his daughters. He is concerned that they are all silly and ignorant, but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters. Mr. Bennet is an odd mixture of quick wit, sarcasm, and caprice, something his wife has not been able to understand fully after 23 years. Mrs. Bennet is a woman of low intelligence and bad temper. Their main goal in life is to get their daughters married off. When Mr. Bennet unexpectedly announces he is going to visit Mr. Bingley, Elizabeth is the only one who knows why. The passage discusses Mr. Bingley and whether or not he will be introduced to Mrs. Long. It is concluded that Mrs. Bennet will not do the introducing because she does not know him well enough herself. The girls' father will take it upon himself to decline Mr. Bingley's acquaintance after Mrs. Bennet declares she is sick of him. The passage describes Mr. Bennet's reaction to his wife's news that their girls had met a new young man. He is pleased and amused, and predicts that the man will soon be asking one of them to dance. His wife and daughters then try to get more information about him from Mr. Bennet, but he is evasive. Lady Lucas reports that Bingley is young, handsome, and agreeable, and that he plans to attend the next assembly with a large party. Mrs. Bennet is pleased at the prospect of one of her daughters marrying Bingley, and an invitation to dinner is dispatched. However, Bingley must go to town the following day and is unable to accept. Mr. Bingley arrives in Hertfordshire and is quickly followed by rumors that he is bringing a large party of twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the ball. Upon his arrival, it is revealed that he has only brought six people with him. Mr. Bingley is a good-looking man with easy manners, while his sisters are fashionable women. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, looks like a gentleman, and his friend Mr. Darcy is a tall and handsome man who quickly catches the attention of the room. Mr. Darcy is a wealthy man who is considered to be very handsome, but he is also very proud and arrogant. He spends most of the evening at a ball walking around the room, and people hope he will not return. Mrs. Bennet is one of the people who strongly dislikes him. The passage describes Mr. Darcy's conversation with Mr. Bingley about the Bennet sisters. Mr. Darcy is not interested in dancing with any of the Bennet sisters, but Mr. Bingley finds them all very pleasant and pretty. Mr. Darcy is rude to Elizabeth and she is not pleased. Mr. Bennet is up late, reading, when his wife comes home from a ball. She reports that Jane was much admired and danced twice with Mr. Bingley. Mr. Bennet is pleased to hear this. Mrs. Bennet is delighted with Mr. Bingley, who she thinks is very handsome, and his sisters, who she thinks are charming women. However, she cannot stand Mr. Darcy, who she thinks is a very disagreeable, conceited man. Jane agrees with her mother about Mr. Bingley, and expresses admiration for him. This passage discusses Elizabeth's surprise at being complimented by a young man, and her friend's observations about her tendency to see the good in everyone. The passage describes the sisters of a man that the speaker likes. The speaker thinks they are proud and conceited, but notes that they are still pleasant to talk to. Mr. Bingley inherited property from his father and intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it. His sisters were very anxious for him to have an estate of his own. Mr. Bingley was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House and took it immediately. Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of great opposition of character. Darcy and Bingley have very different opinions of the people they meet at the Meryton assembly. Bingley find everyone pleasant and pretty, while Darcy finds them uninteresting and unattractive. The passage describes the family of Sir William Lucas, who lived near the Bennets and with whom they were close friends. Lady Lucas was a kind woman, and their eldest daughter was a sensible young woman whom Elizabeth liked. The Miss Lucases and Miss Bennets meet to discuss a ball, and Mrs. Bennet mentions that Mr. Bingley seemed to prefer Jane to any of the other girls. Charlotte then tells her about overhearing a conversation between Mr. Darcy and Mr. Robinson, in which Mr. Darcy says that Jane is the prettiest girl in the room. This passage discusses Mr. Darcy's perceived rudeness at a ball, with Miss Bingley claiming he is much more agreeable among his intimates. Mrs. Long says he said nothing to her at the ball, and Jane speculates that it may be because Mrs. Long does not have a carriage. Miss Lucas says she would not mind if he did not talk to her, but she wishes he had danced with Elizabeth.\n\nLast chunk: _tolerable_.\u201d        \u201cI beg you would not put it into Lizzy\u2019s head to be vexed by his       ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man that it would       be quite a misfortune to be liked by him.

But I can guess how       it was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare       say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage,       and had come to the ball in a hack chaise.\u201d        \u201cI do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,\u201d said Miss Lucas,       \u201cbut I wish he had danced with Eliza.\u201d        \u201cAnother time, Lizzy,\u201d said her mother, \u201cI would not dance with       _him_, if I were you.\u201d        \u201cI believe, ma\u2019am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with       him.\u201d        \u201cHis pride,\u201d said Miss Lucas, \u201cdoes not offend _me_ so much as       pride\n\nNext chunk:", "completion": " often does, because there is an excuse for it.

The passage describes Mr. Darcy's conversation with Mr. Bingley about the Bennet sisters. Mr. Darcy is not interested in dancing with any of the Bennet sisters, but Mr. Bingley finds them all very pleasant and pretty. Mr. Darcy is rude to Elizabeth and she is not pleased. Mr. Bennet is up late, reading, when his wife comes home from a ball. She reports that Jane was much admired and danced twice with Mr. Bingley. Mr. Bennet is pleased to hear this. Mrs. Bennet is delighted with Mr. Bingley, who she thinks is very handsome, and his sisters, who she thinks are charming women. However, she cannot stand Mr. Darcy, who she thinks is a very disagreeable, conceited man. Jane agrees with her mother about Mr. Bingley, and expresses admiration for him. This passage discusses Elizabeth's surprise at being complimented by a young man, and her friend's observations about her tendency to see the good in everyone. The passage describes the sisters of a man that the speaker likes. The speaker thinks they are proud and conceited, but notes that they are still pleasant to talk to. Mr. Bingley inherited property from his father and intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it. His sisters were very anxious for him to have an estate of his own. Mr. Bingley was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House and took it immediately. Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of great opposition of character. Darcy and Bingley have very different opinions of the people they meet at the Meryton assembly. Bingley find everyone pleasant and pretty, while Darcy finds them uninteresting and unattractive. The passage describes the family of Sir William Lucas, who lived near the Bennets and with whom they were close friends. Lady Lucas was a kind woman, and their eldest daughter was a sensible young woman whom Elizabeth liked. The Miss Lucases and Miss Bennets meet to discuss a ball, and Mrs. Bennet mentions that Mr. Bingley seemed to prefer Jane to any of the other girls. Charlotte then tells her about overhearing a conversation between Mr. Darcy and Mr. Robinson, in which Mr. Darcy says that Jane is the prettiest girl in the room. This passage discusses Mr. Darcy's perceived rudeness at a ball, with Miss Bingley claiming he is much more agreeable among his intimates. Mrs. Long says he said nothing to her at the ball, and Jane speculates that it may be because Mrs. Long does not have a carriage. Miss Lucas says she would not mind if he did not talk to her, but she wishes he had danced with Elizabeth. The passage discusses pride and how it is often mistaken for vanity. Pride is a feeling of self-satisfaction, while vanity is caring what others think of us. The passage also includes a conversation between Mrs. Bennet and her son Lucas, in which Lucas says he would drink a bottle of wine every day if he were as rich as Mr. Darcy. Mrs. Bennet tells him that if she saw him doing that, she would take away his bottle. The ladies of Longbourn visit the ladies of Netherfield, and it is evident that Mr. Bingley admires Jane. Jane is pleased by this, and Miss Lucas agrees that it is a good thing that Jane is not likely to be suspected by the world of being in love.\n\nLast chunk: that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.     Chapter 6        The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The       visit was returned in due form. Miss Bennet\u2019s pleasing       manners grew on the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and       though the mother was found to be intolerable, and the younger       sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted       with _them_ was expressed towards the two eldest. By Jane this       attention was received with the greatest pleasure; but Elizabeth       still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody,       hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though       their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in       all probability from the influence of their brother\u2019s admiration.       It was generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire       her; and to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to       the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the       first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she       considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered       by the world in general, since Jane united with great strength       of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of       manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the       impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.        \u201cIt may perhaps be pleasant,\u201d replied\n\nNext chunk:", "completion": " Charlotte, \u201cto be able to       impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a       disadvantage to be so very guarded.

The passage describes Mr. Bennet's reaction to his wife's suggestion that they visit Mr. Bingley, a wealthy single man who is moving into the neighborhood. Mr. Bennet is not interested in meeting Mr. Bingley, but his wife insists that they do so. Mr. Bennet is over scrupulous and is preventing Mr. Bingley from marrying one of his daughters. He is concerned that they are all silly and ignorant, but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters. Mr. Bennet is an odd mixture of quick wit, sarcasm, and caprice, something his wife has not been able to understand fully after 23 years. Mrs. Bennet is a woman of low intelligence and bad temper. Their main goal in life is to get their daughters married off. When Mr. Bennet unexpectedly announces he is going to visit Mr. Bingley, Elizabeth is the only one who knows why. The passage discusses Mr. Bingley and whether or not he will be introduced to Mrs. Long. It is concluded that Mrs. Bennet will not do the introducing because she does not know him well enough herself. The girls' father will take it upon himself to decline Mr. Bingley's acquaintance after Mrs. Bennet declares she is sick of him. The passage describes Mr. Bennet's reaction to his wife's news that their girls had met a new young man. He is pleased and amused, and predicts that the man will soon be asking one of them to dance. His wife and daughters then try to get more information about him from Mr. Bennet, but he is evasive. Lady Lucas reports that Bingley is young, handsome, and agreeable, and that he plans to attend the next assembly with a large party. Mrs. Bennet is pleased at the prospect of one of her daughters marrying Bingley, and an invitation to dinner is dispatched. However, Bingley must go to town the following day and is unable to accept. Mr. Bingley arrives in Hertfordshire and is quickly followed by rumors that he is bringing a large party of twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the ball. Upon his arrival, it is revealed that he has only brought six people with him. Mr. Bingley is a good-looking man with easy manners, while his sisters are fashionable women. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, looks like a gentleman, and his friend Mr. Darcy is a tall and handsome man who quickly catches the attention of the room.

The passage describes Mr. Bennet's reaction to his wife's suggestion that they visit Mr. Bingley, a wealthy single man who is moving into the neighborhood. Mr. Bennet is not interested in meeting Mr. Bingley, but his wife insists that they do so. Mr. Bennet is over scrupulous and is preventing Mr. Bingley from marrying one of his daughters. He is concerned that they are all silly and ignorant, but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters. Mr. Bennet is an odd mixture of quick wit, sarcasm, and caprice, something his wife has not been able to understand fully after 23 years. Mrs. Bennet is a woman of low intelligence and bad temper. Their main goal in life is to get their daughters married off. When Mr. Bennet unexpectedly announces he is going to visit Mr. Bingley, Elizabeth is the only one who knows why. The passage discusses Mr. Bingley and whether or not he will be introduced to Mrs. Long. It is concluded that Mrs. Bennet will not do the introducing because she does not know him well enough herself. The girls' father will take it upon himself to decline Mr. Bingley's acquaintance after Mrs. Bennet declares she is sick of him. The passage describes Mr. Bennet's reaction to his wife's news that their girls had met a new young man. He is pleased and amused, and predicts that the man will soon be asking one of them to dance. His wife and daughters then try to get more information about him from Mr. Bennet, but he is evasive. Lady Lucas reports that Bingley is young, handsome, and agreeable, and that he plans to attend the next assembly with a large party. Mrs. Bennet is pleased at the prospect of one of her daughters marrying Bingley, and an invitation to dinner is dispatched. However, Bingley must go to town the following day and is unable to accept. Mr. Bingley arrives in Hertfordshire and is quickly followed by rumors that he is bringing a large party of twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the ball. Upon his arrival, it is revealed that he has only brought six people with him. Mr. Bingley is a good-looking man with easy manners, while his sisters are fashionable women. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, looks like a gentleman, and his friend Mr. Darcy is a tall and handsome man who quickly catches the attention of the room. Mr. Darcy is a wealthy man who is considered to be very handsome, but he is also very proud and arrogant. He spends most of the evening at a ball walking around the room, and people hope he will not return. Mrs. Bennet is one of the people who strongly dislikes him. The passage describes Mr. Darcy's conversation with Mr. Bingley about the Bennet sisters. Mr. Darcy is not interested in dancing with any of the Bennet sisters, but Mr. Bingley finds them all very pleasant and pretty. Mr. Darcy is rude to Elizabeth and she is not pleased. Mr. Bennet is up late, reading, when his wife comes home from a ball. She reports that Jane was much admired and danced twice with Mr. Bingley. Mr. Bennet is pleased to hear this. Mrs. Bennet is delighted with Mr. Bingley, who she thinks is very handsome, and his sisters, who she thinks are charming women. However, she cannot stand Mr. Darcy, who she thinks is a very disagreeable, conceited man. Jane agrees with her mother about Mr. Bingley, and expresses admiration for him. This passage discusses Elizabeth's surprise at being complimented by a young man, and her friend's observations about her tendency to see the good in everyone. The passage describes the sisters of a man that the speaker likes. The speaker thinks they are proud and conceited, but notes that they are still pleasant to talk to. Mr. Bingley inherited property from his father and intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it. His sisters were very anxious for him to have an estate of his own. Mr. Bingley was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House and took it immediately. Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of great opposition of character. Darcy and Bingley have very different opinions of the people they meet at the Meryton assembly. Bingley find everyone pleasant and pretty, while Darcy finds them uninteresting and unattractive. The passage describes the family of Sir William Lucas, who lived near the Bennets and with whom they were close friends. Lady Lucas was a kind woman, and their eldest daughter was a sensible young woman whom Elizabeth liked. The Miss Lucases and Miss Bennets meet to discuss a ball, and Mrs. Bennet mentions that Mr. Bingley seemed to prefer Jane to any of the other girls. Charlotte then tells her about overhearing a conversation between Mr. Darcy and Mr. Robinson, in which Mr. Darcy says that Jane is the prettiest girl in the room. This passage discusses Mr. Darcy's perceived rudeness at a ball, with Miss Bingley claiming he is much more agreeable among his intimates. Mrs. Long says he said nothing to her at the ball, and Jane speculates that it may be because Mrs. Long does not have a carriage. Miss Lucas says she would not mind if he did not talk to her, but she wishes he had danced with Elizabeth. The passage discusses pride and how it is often mistaken for vanity. Pride is a feeling of self-satisfaction, while vanity is caring what others think of us. The passage also includes a conversation between Mrs. Bennet and her son Lucas, in which Lucas says he would drink a bottle of wine every day if he were as rich as Mr. Darcy. Mrs. Bennet tells him that if she saw him doing that, she would take away his bottle. The ladies of Longbourn visit the ladies of Netherfield, and it is evident that Mr. Bingley admires Jane. Jane is pleased by this, and Miss Lucas agrees that it is a good thing that Jane is not likely to be suspected by the world of being in love. The passage discusses how women should act around the men they are interested in. It is better for a woman to show more interest than she actually feels, as this will give the man encouragement. The passage discusses a plan for Jane to marry a rich husband, and Elizabeth agrees that it is a good idea if that is what Jane wants. However, Elizabeth points out that Jane does not yet know enough about the man to be certain of her feelings. Charlotte wishes Jane well. This passage discusses the idea that happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. The author argues that it is better to know as little as possible about the defects of the person you are going to spend your life with. The author also observes that Mr. Darcy, who initially thought Elizabeth was not pretty, began to find her more attractive after he realized that she was intelligent and had expressive eyes.\n\nLast chunk: morrow, I should think she had       as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his       character for a twelvemonth.

The passage describes Mr. Bennet's reaction to his wife's suggestion that they visit Mr. Bingley, a wealthy single man who is moving into the neighborhood. Mr. Bennet is not interested in meeting Mr. Bingley, but his wife insists that they do so. Mr. Bennet is over scrupulous and is preventing Mr. Bingley from marrying one of his daughters. He is concerned that they are all silly and ignorant, but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters. Mr. Bennet is an odd mixture of quick wit, sarcasm, and caprice, something his wife has not been able to understand fully after 23 years. Mrs. Bennet is a woman of low intelligence and bad temper. Their main goal in life is to get their daughters married off. When Mr. Bennet unexpectedly announces he is going to visit Mr. Bingley, Elizabeth is the only one who knows why. The passage discusses Mr. Bingley and whether or not he will be introduced to Mrs. Long. It is concluded that Mrs. Bennet will not do the introducing because she does not know him well enough herself. The girls' father will take it upon himself to decline Mr. Bingley's acquaintance after Mrs. Bennet declares she is sick of him. The passage describes Mr. Bennet's reaction to his wife's news that their girls had met a new young man. He is pleased and amused, and predicts that the man will soon be asking one of them to dance. His wife and daughters then try to get more information about him from Mr. Bennet, but he is evasive. Lady Lucas reports that Bingley is young, handsome, and agreeable, and that he plans to attend the next assembly with a large party. Mrs. Bennet is pleased at the prospect of one of her daughters marrying Bingley, and an invitation to dinner is dispatched. However, Bingley must go to town the following day and is unable to accept. Mr. Bingley arrives in Hertfordshire and is quickly followed by rumors that he is bringing a large party of twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the ball. Upon his arrival, it is revealed that he has only brought six people with him. Mr. Bingley is a good-looking man with easy manners, while his sisters are fashionable women. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, looks like a gentleman, and his friend Mr. Darcy is a tall and handsome man who quickly catches the attention of the room. Mr. Darcy is a wealthy man who is considered to be very handsome, but he is also very proud and arrogant. He spends most of the evening at a ball walking around the room, and people hope he will not return. Mrs. Bennet is one of the people who strongly dislikes him. The passage describes Mr. Darcy's conversation with Mr. Bingley about the Bennet sisters. Mr. Darcy is not interested in dancing with any of the Bennet sisters, but Mr. Bingley finds them all very pleasant and pretty. Mr. Darcy is rude to Elizabeth and she is not pleased. Mr. Bennet is up late, reading, when his wife comes home from a ball. She reports that Jane was much admired and danced twice with Mr. Bingley. Mr. Bennet is pleased to hear this. Mrs. Bennet is delighted with Mr. Bingley, who she thinks is very handsome, and his sisters, who she thinks are charming women. However, she cannot stand Mr. Darcy, who she thinks is a very disagreeable, conceited man. Jane agrees with her mother about Mr. Bingley, and expresses admiration for him. This passage discusses Elizabeth's surprise at being complimented by a young man, and her friend's observations about her tendency to see the good in everyone. The passage describes the sisters of a man that the speaker likes. The speaker thinks they are proud and conceited, but notes that they are still pleasant to talk to. Mr. Bingley inherited property from his father and intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it. His sisters were very anxious for him to have an estate of his own. Mr. Bingley was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House and took it immediately. Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of great opposition of character. Darcy and Bingley have very different opinions of the people they meet at the Meryton assembly. Bingley find everyone pleasant and pretty, while Darcy finds them uninteresting and unattractive. The passage describes the family of Sir William Lucas, who lived near the Bennets and with whom they were close friends. Lady Lucas was a kind woman, and their eldest daughter was a sensible young woman whom Elizabeth liked. The Miss Lucases and Miss Bennets meet to discuss a ball, and Mrs. Bennet mentions that Mr. Bingley seemed to prefer Jane to any of the other girls. Charlotte then tells her about overhearing a conversation between Mr. Darcy and Mr. Robinson, in which Mr. Darcy says that Jane is the prettiest girl in the room. This passage discusses Mr. Darcy's perceived rudeness at a ball, with Miss Bingley claiming he is much more agreeable among his intimates. Mrs. Long says he said nothing to her at the ball, and Jane speculates that it may be because Mrs. Long does not have a carriage. Miss Lucas says she would not mind if he did not talk to her, but she wishes he had danced with Elizabeth. The passage discusses pride and how it is often mistaken for vanity. Pride is a feeling of self-satisfaction, while vanity is caring what others think of us. The passage also includes a conversation between Mrs. Bennet and her son Lucas, in which Lucas says he would drink a bottle of wine every day if he were as rich as Mr. Darcy. Mrs. Bennet tells him that if she saw him doing that, she would take away his bottle. The ladies of Longbourn visit the ladies of Netherfield, and it is evident that Mr. Bingley admires Jane. Jane is pleased by this, and Miss Lucas agrees that it is a good thing that Jane is not likely to be suspected by the world of being in love. The passage discusses how women should act around the men they are interested in. It is better for a woman to show more interest than she actually feels, as this will give the man encouragement. The passage discusses a plan for Jane to marry a rich husband, and Elizabeth agrees that it is a good idea if that is what Jane wants. However, Elizabeth points out that Jane does not yet know enough about the man to be certain of her feelings. Charlotte wishes Jane well. This passage discusses the idea that happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. The author argues that it is better to know as little as possible about the defects of the person you are going to spend your life with. The author also observes that Mr. Darcy, who initially thought Elizabeth was not pretty, began to find her more attractive after he realized that she was intelligent and had expressive eyes. Mr. Darcy begins to take notice of a woman who he previously thought to be uninteresting. He admires her figure and her playful demeanor, and starts to wish he knew more about her. When he overhears her talking to a friend, he is amused by her impertinence and decides to speak to her. The lady in the passage is reluctant to play and sing for others, but does so anyway. Her sister Mary is eager to display her own talents and takes over the instrument after a few songs.\n\nLast chunk: Meryton?\u201d        \u201cWith great energy; but it is a subject which always makes a lady       energetic.\u201d        \u201cYou are severe on us.\u201d        \u201cIt will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,\u201d said Miss Lucas. \u201cI am       going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.\u201d        \u201cYou are a very strange creature by way of a friend!\u2014always       wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody!

After a       song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of       several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at       the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence of       being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge       and accomplishments, was always impatient for display.        Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given       her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and\n\nNext chunk:", "completion": " conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of       excellence than she had reached.

The passage describes Mr. Bennet's reaction to his wife's suggestion that they visit Mr. Bingley, a wealthy single man who is moving into the neighborhood. Mr. Bennet is not interested in meeting Mr. Bingley, but his wife insists that they do so. Mr. Bennet is over scrupulous and is preventing Mr. Bingley from marrying one of his daughters. He is concerned that they are all silly and ignorant, but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters. Mr. Bennet is an odd mixture of quick wit, sarcasm, and caprice, something his wife has not been able to understand fully after 23 years. Mrs. Bennet is a woman of low intelligence and bad temper. Their main goal in life is to get their daughters married off. When Mr. Bennet unexpectedly announces he is going to visit Mr. Bingley, Elizabeth is the only one who knows why. The passage discusses Mr. Bingley and whether or not he will be introduced to Mrs. Long. It is concluded that Mrs. Bennet will not do the introducing because she does not know him well enough herself. The girls' father will take it upon himself to decline Mr. Bingley's acquaintance after Mrs. Bennet declares she is sick of him. The passage describes Mr. Bennet's reaction to his wife's news that their girls had met a new young man. He is pleased and amused, and predicts that the man will soon be asking one of them to dance. His wife and daughters then try to get more information about him from Mr. Bennet, but he is evasive. Lady Lucas reports that Bingley is young, handsome, and agreeable, and that he plans to attend the next assembly with a large party. Mrs. Bennet is pleased at the prospect of one of her daughters marrying Bingley, and an invitation to dinner is dispatched. However, Bingley must go to town the following day and is unable to accept. Mr. Bingley arrives in Hertfordshire and is quickly followed by rumors that he is bringing a large party of twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the ball. Upon his arrival, it is revealed that he has only brought six people with him. Mr. Bingley is a good-looking man with easy manners, while his sisters are fashionable women. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, looks like a gentleman, and his friend Mr. Darcy is a tall and handsome man who quickly catches the attention of the room. Mr. Darcy is a wealthy man who is considered to be very handsome, but he is also very proud and arrogant. He spends most of the evening at a ball walking around the room, and people hope he will not return. Mrs. Bennet is one of the people who strongly dislikes him. The passage describes Mr. Darcy's conversation with Mr. Bingley about the Bennet sisters. Mr. Darcy is not interested in dancing with any of the Bennet sisters, but Mr. Bingley finds them all very pleasant and pretty. Mr. Darcy is rude to Elizabeth and she is not pleased. Mr. Bennet is up late, reading, when his wife comes home from a ball. She reports that Jane was much admired and danced twice with Mr. Bingley. Mr. Bennet is pleased to hear this. Mrs. Bennet is delighted with Mr. Bingley, who she thinks is very handsome, and his sisters, who she thinks are charming women. However, she cannot stand Mr. Darcy, who she thinks is a very disagreeable, conceited man. Jane agrees with her mother about Mr. Bingley, and expresses admiration for him. This passage discusses Elizabeth's surprise at being complimented by a young man, and her friend's observations about her tendency to see the good in everyone. The passage describes the sisters of a man that the speaker likes. The speaker thinks they are proud and conceited, but notes that they are still pleasant to talk to. Mr. Bingley inherited property from his father and intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it. His sisters were very anxious for him to have an estate of his own. Mr. Bingley was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House and took it immediately. Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of great opposition of character. Darcy and Bingley have very different opinions of the people they meet at the Meryton assembly. Bingley find everyone pleasant and pretty, while Darcy finds them uninteresting and unattractive. The passage describes the family of Sir William Lucas, who lived near the Bennets and with whom they were close friends. Lady Lucas was a kind woman, and their eldest daughter was a sensible young woman whom Elizabeth liked. The Miss Lucases and Miss Bennets meet to discuss a ball, and Mrs. Bennet mentions that Mr. Bingley seemed to prefer Jane to any of the other girls. Charlotte then tells her about overhearing a conversation between Mr. Darcy and Mr. Robinson, in which Mr. Darcy says that Jane is the prettiest girl in the room. This passage discusses Mr. Darcy's perceived rudeness at a ball, with Miss Bingley claiming he is much more agreeable among his intimates. Mrs. Long says he said nothing to her at the ball, and Jane speculates that it may be because Mrs. Long does not have a carriage. Miss Lucas says she would not mind if he did not talk to her, but she wishes he had danced with Elizabeth. The passage discusses pride and how it is often mistaken for vanity. Pride is a feeling of self-satisfaction, while vanity is caring what others think of us. The passage also includes a conversation between Mrs. Bennet and her son Lucas, in which Lucas says he would drink a bottle of wine every day if he were as rich as Mr. Darcy. Mrs. Bennet tells him that if she saw him doing that, she would take away his bottle. The ladies of Longbourn visit the ladies of Netherfield, and it is evident that Mr. Bingley admires Jane. Jane is pleased by this, and Miss Lucas agrees that it is a good thing that Jane is not likely to be suspected by the world of being in love. The passage discusses how women should act around the men they are interested in. It is better for a woman to show more interest than she actually feels, as this will give the man encouragement. The passage discusses a plan for Jane to marry a rich husband, and Elizabeth agrees that it is a good idea if that is what Jane wants. However, Elizabeth points out that Jane does not yet know enough about the man to be certain of her feelings. Charlotte wishes Jane well. This passage discusses the idea that happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. The author argues that it is better to know as little as possible about the defects of the person you are going to spend your life with. The author also observes that Mr. Darcy, who initially thought Elizabeth was not pretty, began to find her more attractive after he realized that she was intelligent and had expressive eyes. Mr. Darcy begins to take notice of a woman who he previously thought to be uninteresting. He admires her figure and her playful demeanor, and starts to wish he knew more about her. When he overhears her talking to a friend, he is amused by her impertinence and decides to speak to her. The lady in the passage is reluctant to play and sing for others, but does so anyway. Her sister Mary is eager to display her own talents and takes over the instrument after a few songs. The passage describes a group of people dancing at a party. Mr. Darcy is standing near them, looking disapproving. Sir William Lucas comments on how much he enjoys dancing, and Mr. Darcy agrees that it is a pleasant activity. This passage describes a conversation between Mr. Darcy and Sir William, in which Sir William tries to convince Darcy to dance with Elizabeth. Darcy is hesitant, but Sir William persists and eventually Darcy agrees. Elizabeth, however, is not interested in dancing with Darcy and quickly turns him down.\n\nLast chunk: you often dance at St. James\u2019s?\u201d        \u201cNever, sir.\u201d        \u201cDo you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?\u201d        \u201cIt is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid       it.\u201d        \u201cYou have a house in town, I conclude?\u201d        Mr. Darcy bowed.        \u201cI had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself\u2014for I am       fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that       the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas.\u201d        He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not       disposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving       towards them, he was struck with the notion of doing a very       gallant thing, and called out to her,        \u201cMy dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must       allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable       partner. You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much       beauty is before you.\u201d And, taking her hand, he would have given       it to Mr. Darcy, who, though extremely surprised, was not       unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back, and said       with some discomposure to Sir William,        \u201cIndeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I       entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg       for a partner.\u201d        Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the       honour of her hand, but in vain.

His wife and daughters then try to get more information about him from Mr. Bennet, but he is evasive. Lady Lucas reports that Bingley is young, handsome, and agreeable, and that he plans to attend the next assembly with a large party. Mrs. Bennet is pleased at the prospect of one of her daughters marrying Bingley, and an invitation to dinner is dispatched. However, Bingley must go to town the following day and is unable to accept. Mr. Bingley arrives in Hertfordshire and is quickly followed by rumors that he is bringing a large party of twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the ball. Upon his arrival, it is revealed that he has only brought six people with him. Mr. Bingley is a good-looking man with easy manners, while his sisters are fashionable women. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, looks like a gentleman, and his friend Mr. Darcy is a tall and handsome man who quickly catches the attention of the room. Mr. Darcy is a wealthy man who is considered to be very handsome, but he is also very proud and arrogant. He spends most of the evening at a ball walking around the room, and people hope he will not return. Mrs. Bennet is one of the people who strongly dislikes him. The passage describes Mr. Darcy's conversation with Mr. Bingley about the Bennet sisters. Mr. Darcy is not interested in dancing with any of the Bennet sisters, but Mr. Bingley finds them all very pleasant and pretty. Mr. Darcy is rude to Elizabeth and she is not pleased. Mr. Bennet is up late, reading, when his wife comes home from a ball. She reports that Jane was much admired and danced twice with Mr. Bingley. Mr. Bennet is pleased to hear this. Mrs. Bennet is delighted with Mr. Bingley, who she thinks is very handsome, and his sisters, who she thinks are charming women. However, she cannot stand Mr. Darcy, who she thinks is a very disagreeable, conceited man. Jane agrees with her mother about Mr. Bingley, and expresses admiration for him. This passage discusses Elizabeth's surprise at being complimented by a young man, and her friend's observations about her tendency to see the good in everyone. The passage describes the sisters of a man that the speaker likes. The speaker thinks they are proud and conceited, but notes that they are still pleasant to talk to. Mr. Bingley inherited property from his father and intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it. His sisters were very anxious for him to have an estate of his own. Mr. Bingley was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House and took it immediately. Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of great opposition of character. Darcy and Bingley have very different opinions of the people they meet at the Meryton assembly. Bingley find everyone pleasant and pretty, while Darcy finds them uninteresting and unattractive. The passage describes the family of Sir William Lucas, who lived near the Bennets and with whom they were close friends. Lady Lucas was a kind woman, and their eldest daughter was a sensible young woman whom Elizabeth liked. The Miss Lucases and Miss Bennets meet to discuss a ball, and Mrs. Bennet mentions that Mr. Bingley seemed to prefer Jane to any of the other girls. Charlotte then tells her about overhearing a conversation between Mr. Darcy and Mr. Robinson, in which Mr. Darcy says that Jane is the prettiest girl in the room. This passage discusses Mr. Darcy's perceived rudeness at a ball, with Miss Bingley claiming he is much more agreeable among his intimates. Mrs. Long says he said nothing to her at the ball, and Jane speculates that it may be because Mrs. Long does not have a carriage. Miss Lucas says she would not mind if he did not talk to her, but she wishes he had danced with Elizabeth. The passage discusses pride and how it is often mistaken for vanity. Pride is a feeling of self-satisfaction, while vanity is caring what others think of us. The passage also includes a conversation between Mrs. Bennet and her son Lucas, in which Lucas says he would drink a bottle of wine every day if he were as rich as Mr. Darcy. Mrs. Bennet tells him that if she saw him doing that, she would take away his bottle. The ladies of Longbourn visit the ladies of Netherfield, and it is evident that Mr. Bingley admires Jane. Jane is pleased by this, and Miss Lucas agrees that it is a good thing that Jane is not likely to be suspected by the world of being in love. The passage discusses how women should act around the men they are interested in. It is better for a woman to show more interest than she actually feels, as this will give the man encouragement. The passage discusses a plan for Jane to marry a rich husband, and Elizabeth agrees that it is a good idea if that is what Jane wants. However, Elizabeth points out that Jane does not yet know enough about the man to be certain of her feelings. Charlotte wishes Jane well. This passage discusses the idea that happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. The author argues that it is better to know as little as possible about the defects of the person you are going to spend your life with. The author also observes that Mr. Darcy, who initially thought Elizabeth was not pretty, began to find her more attractive after he realized that she was intelligent and had expressive eyes. Mr. Darcy begins to take notice of a woman who he previously thought to be uninteresting. He admires her figure and her playful demeanor, and starts to wish he knew more about her. When he overhears her talking to a friend, he is amused by her impertinence and decides to speak to her. The lady in the passage is reluctant to play and sing for others, but does so anyway. Her sister Mary is eager to display her own talents and takes over the instrument after a few songs. The passage describes a group of people dancing at a party. Mr. Darcy is standing near them, looking disapproving. Sir William Lucas comments on how much he enjoys dancing, and Mr. Darcy agrees that it is a pleasant activity.

Miss Bingley is jealous and tries to find out what Darcy is thinking about, but he insists he was thinking about something else entirely. The passage describes Mr. Darcy's reaction to Miss Bingley's surprise at his admiration for Miss Elizabeth Bennet. He explains that a woman's imagination is very rapid, and that he knew she would be wishing him joy. Miss Bingley then declares that the matter is settled, and that Mr. Darcy will have a charming mother-in-law.\n\nLast chunk: her what lady had the credit of inspiring such       reflections. Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity,        \u201cMiss Elizabeth Bennet.\u201d        \u201cMiss Elizabeth Bennet!\u201d repeated Miss Bingley. \u201cI am all       astonishment.

Chapter 7        Mr. Bennet\u2019s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of       two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was       entailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and       their mother\u2019s fortune, though ample for her situation in life,       could but ill supply the deficiency of his. Her father had been       an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.        She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk       to their father, and succeeded him in\n\nNext chunk:", "completion": " the business, and a brother       settled in London in a respectable line of trade.

The two       youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly       frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than       their sisters\u2019, and when nothing better offered, a walk to       Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish       conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the       country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some       from their aunt.

The passage describes Mr. Bennet's reaction to his wife's suggestion that they visit Mr. Bingley, a wealthy single man who is moving into the neighborhood. Mr. Bennet is not interested in meeting Mr. Bingley, but his wife insists that they do so. Mr. Bennet is over scrupulous and is preventing Mr. Bingley from marrying one of his daughters. He is concerned that they are all silly and ignorant, but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters. Mr. Bennet is an odd mixture of quick wit, sarcasm, and caprice, something his wife has not been able to understand fully after 23 years. Mrs. Bennet is a woman of low intelligence and bad temper. Their main goal in life is to get their daughters married off. When Mr. Bennet unexpectedly announces he is going to visit Mr. Bingley, Elizabeth is the only one who knows why. The passage discusses Mr. Bingley and whether or not he will be introduced to Mrs. Long.

Mr. Bennet is up late, reading, when his wife comes home from a ball. She reports that Jane was much admired and danced twice with Mr. Bingley. Mr. Bennet is pleased to hear this. Mrs. Bennet is delighted with Mr. Bingley, who she thinks is very handsome, and his sisters, who she thinks are charming women. However, she cannot stand Mr. Darcy, who she thinks is a very disagreeable, conceited man. Jane agrees with her mother about Mr. Bingley, and expresses admiration for him. This passage discusses Elizabeth's surprise at being complimented by a young man, and her friend's observations about her tendency to see the good in everyone. The passage describes the sisters of a man that the speaker likes. The speaker thinks they are proud and conceited, but notes that they are still pleasant to talk to. Mr. Bingley inherited property from his father and intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it. His sisters were very anxious for him to have an estate of his own. Mr. Bingley was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House and took it immediately. Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of great opposition of character. Darcy and Bingley have very different opinions of the people they meet at the Meryton assembly. Bingley find everyone pleasant and pretty, while Darcy finds them uninteresting and unattractive. The passage describes the family of Sir William Lucas, who lived near the Bennets and with whom they were close friends. Lady Lucas was a kind woman, and their eldest daughter was a sensible young woman whom Elizabeth liked. The Miss Lucases and Miss Bennets meet to discuss a ball, and Mrs. Bennet mentions that Mr. Bingley seemed to prefer Jane to any of the other girls. Charlotte then tells her about overhearing a conversation between Mr. Darcy and Mr. Robinson, in which Mr. Darcy says that Jane is the prettiest girl in the room. This passage discusses Mr. Darcy's perceived rudeness at a ball, with Miss Bingley claiming he is much more agreeable among his intimates. Mrs. Long says he said nothing to her at the ball, and Jane speculates that it may be because Mrs. Long does not have a carriage. Miss Lucas says she would not mind if he did not talk to her, but she wishes he had danced with Elizabeth. The passage discusses pride and how it is often mistaken for vanity. Pride is a feeling of self-satisfaction, while vanity is caring what others think of us. The passage also includes a conversation between Mrs. Bennet and her son Lucas, in which Lucas says he would drink a bottle of wine every day if he were as rich as Mr. Darcy. Mrs. Bennet tells him that if she saw him doing that, she would take away his bottle. The ladies of Longbourn visit the ladies of Netherfield, and it is evident that Mr. Bingley admires Jane. Jane is pleased by this, and Miss Lucas agrees that it is a good thing that Jane is not likely to be suspected by the world of being in love. The passage discusses how women should act around the men they are interested in. It is better for a woman to show more interest than she actually feels, as this will give the man encouragement. The passage discusses a plan for Jane to marry a rich husband, and Elizabeth agrees that it is a good idea if that is what Jane wants. However, Elizabeth points out that Jane does not yet know enough about the man to be certain of her feelings. Charlotte wishes Jane well. This passage discusses the idea that happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. The author argues that it is better to know as little as possible about the defects of the person you are going to spend your life with. The author also observes that Mr. Darcy, who initially thought Elizabeth was not pretty, began to find her more attractive after he realized that she was intelligent and had expressive eyes. Mr. Darcy begins to take notice of a woman who he previously thought to be uninteresting. He admires her figure and her playful demeanor, and starts to wish he knew more about her. When he overhears her talking to a friend, he is amused by her impertinence and decides to speak to her. The lady in the passage is reluctant to play and sing for others, but does so anyway. Her sister Mary is eager to display her own talents and takes over the instrument after a few songs. The passage describes a group of people dancing at a party. Mr. Darcy is standing near them, looking disapproving. Sir William Lucas comments on how much he enjoys dancing, and Mr. Darcy agrees that it is a pleasant activity. This passage describes a conversation between Mr. Darcy and Sir William, in which Sir William tries to convince Darcy to dance with Elizabeth. Darcy is hesitant, but Sir William persists and eventually Darcy agrees. Elizabeth, however, is not interested in dancing with Darcy and quickly turns him down. The passage describes a conversation between Mr. Darcy and Miss Bingley in which Darcy compliments Elizabeth's dancing. Miss Bingley is jealous and tries to find out what Darcy is thinking about, but he insists he was thinking about something else entirely. The passage describes Mr. Darcy's reaction to Miss Bingley's surprise at his admiration for Miss Elizabeth Bennet. He explains that a woman's imagination is very rapid, and that he knew she would be wishing him joy. Miss Bingley then declares that the matter is settled, and that Mr. Darcy will have a charming mother-in-law. The passage describes the excitement of two young women at the arrival of a militia regiment in their neighborhood. They learn the officers' names and connections and visit them often. Mr. Bennet tells his wife that he thinks their two youngest daughters are uncommonly foolish, and Mrs. Bennet responds that he should not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother.\n\nLast chunk: fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was       worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an       ensign.        After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject,       Mr. Bennet coolly observed,        \u201cFrom all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must       be two of the silliest girls in the country.

The passage describes Mr. Bennet's reaction to his wife's suggestion that they visit Mr. Bingley, a wealthy single man who is moving into the neighborhood. Mr. Bennet is not interested in meeting Mr. Bingley, but his wife insists that they do so. Mr. Bennet is over scrupulous and is preventing Mr. Bingley from marrying one of his daughters. He is concerned that they are all silly and ignorant, but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters. Mr. Bennet is an odd mixture of quick wit, sarcasm, and caprice, something his wife has not been able to understand fully after 23 years. Mrs. Bennet is a woman of low intelligence and bad temper. Their main goal in life is to get their daughters married off. When Mr. Bennet unexpectedly announces he is going to visit Mr. Bingley, Elizabeth is the only one who knows why. The passage discusses Mr. Bingley and whether or not he will be introduced to Mrs. Long. It is concluded that Mrs. Bennet will not do the introducing because she does not know him well enough herself. The girls' father will take it upon himself to decline Mr. Bingley's acquaintance after Mrs. Bennet declares she is sick of him. The passage describes Mr. Bennet's reaction to his wife's news that their girls had met a new young man. He is pleased and amused, and predicts that the man will soon be asking one of them to dance. His wife and daughters then try to get more information about him from Mr. Bennet, but he is evasive. Lady Lucas reports that Bingley is young, handsome, and agreeable, and that he plans to attend the next assembly with a large party. Mrs. Bennet is pleased at the prospect of one of her daughters marrying Bingley, and an invitation to dinner is dispatched. However, Bingley must go to town the following day and is unable to accept. Mr. Bingley arrives in Hertfordshire and is quickly followed by rumors that he is bringing a large party of twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the ball. Upon his arrival, it is revealed that he has only brought six people with him. Mr. Bingley is a good-looking man with easy manners, while his sisters are fashionable women. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, looks like a gentleman, and his friend Mr. Darcy is a tall and handsome man who quickly catches the attention of the room. Mr. Darcy is a wealthy man who is considered to be very handsome, but he is also very proud and arrogant. He spends most of the evening at a ball walking around the room, and people hope he will not return. Mrs. Bennet is one of the people who strongly dislikes him.

Upon his arrival, it is revealed that he has only brought six people with him. Mr. Bingley is a good-looking man with easy manners, while his sisters are fashionable women. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, looks like a gentleman, and his friend Mr. Darcy is a tall and handsome man who quickly catches the attention of the room. Mr. Darcy is a wealthy man who is considered to be very handsome, but he is also very proud and arrogant. He spends most of the evening at a ball walking around the room, and people hope he will not return. Mrs. Bennet is one of the people who strongly dislikes him. The passage describes Mr. Darcy's conversation with Mr. Bingley about the Bennet sisters. Mr. Darcy is not interested in dancing with any of the Bennet sisters, but Mr. Bingley finds them all very pleasant and pretty. Mr. Darcy is rude to Elizabeth and she is not pleased. Mr. Bennet is up late, reading, when his wife comes home from a ball. She reports that Jane was much admired and danced twice with Mr. Bingley. Mr. Bennet is pleased to hear this. Mrs. Bennet is delighted with Mr. Bingley, who she thinks is very handsome, and his sisters, who she thinks are charming women. However, she cannot stand Mr. Darcy, who she thinks is a very disagreeable, conceited man. Jane agrees with her mother about Mr. Bingley, and expresses admiration for him. This passage discusses Elizabeth's surprise at being complimented by a young man, and her friend's observations about her tendency to see the good in everyone. The passage describes the sisters of a man that the speaker likes. The speaker thinks they are proud and conceited, but notes that they are still pleasant to talk to. Mr. Bingley inherited property from his father and intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it. His sisters were very anxious for him to have an estate of his own. Mr. Bingley was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House and took it immediately. Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of great opposition of character. Darcy and Bingley have very different opinions of the people they meet at the Meryton assembly. Bingley find everyone pleasant and pretty, while Darcy finds them uninteresting and unattractive. The passage describes the family of Sir William Lucas, who lived near the Bennets and with whom they were close friends. Lady Lucas was a kind woman, and their eldest daughter was a sensible young woman whom Elizabeth liked. The Miss Lucases and Miss Bennets meet to discuss a ball, and Mrs. Bennet mentions that Mr. Bingley seemed to prefer Jane to any of the other girls. Charlotte then tells her about overhearing a conversation between Mr. Darcy and Mr. Robinson, in which Mr. Darcy says that Jane is the prettiest girl in the room. This passage discusses Mr. Darcy's perceived rudeness at a ball, with Miss Bingley claiming he is much more agreeable among his intimates. Mrs. Long says he said nothing to her at the ball, and Jane speculates that it may be because Mrs. Long does not have a carriage. Miss Lucas says she would not mind if he did not talk to her, but she wishes he had danced with Elizabeth. The passage discusses pride and how it is often mistaken for vanity. Pride is a feeling of self-satisfaction, while vanity is caring what others think of us. The passage also includes a conversation between Mrs. Bennet and her son Lucas, in which Lucas says he would drink a bottle of wine every day if he were as rich as Mr. Darcy. Mrs. Bennet tells him that if she saw him doing that, she would take away his bottle. The ladies of Longbourn visit the ladies of Netherfield, and it is evident that Mr. Bingley admires Jane. Jane is pleased by this, and Miss Lucas agrees that it is a good thing that Jane is not likely to be suspected by the world of being in love. The passage discusses how women should act around the men they are interested in. It is better for a woman to show more interest than she actually feels, as this will give the man encouragement. The passage discusses a plan for Jane to marry a rich husband, and Elizabeth agrees that it is a good idea if that is what Jane wants. However, Elizabeth points out that Jane does not yet know enough about the man to be certain of her feelings. Charlotte wishes Jane well. This passage discusses the idea that happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. The author argues that it is better to know as little as possible about the defects of the person you are going to spend your life with. The author also observes that Mr. Darcy, who initially thought Elizabeth was not pretty, began to find her more attractive after he realized that she was intelligent and had expressive eyes. Mr. Darcy begins to take notice of a woman who he previously thought to be uninteresting. He admires her figure and her playful demeanor, and starts to wish he knew more about her. When he overhears her talking to a friend, he is amused by her impertinence and decides to speak to her. The lady in the passage is reluctant to play and sing for others, but does so anyway. Her sister Mary is eager to display her own talents and takes over the instrument after a few songs. The passage describes a group of people dancing at a party. Mr. Darcy is standing near them, looking disapproving. Sir William Lucas comments on how much he enjoys dancing, and Mr. Darcy agrees that it is a pleasant activity. This passage describes a conversation between Mr. Darcy and Sir William, in which Sir William tries to convince Darcy to dance with Elizabeth. Darcy is hesitant, but Sir William persists and eventually Darcy agrees. Elizabeth, however, is not interested in dancing with Darcy and quickly turns him down. The passage describes a conversation between Mr. Darcy and Miss Bingley in which Darcy compliments Elizabeth's dancing. Miss Bingley is jealous and tries to find out what Darcy is thinking about, but he insists he was thinking about something else entirely. The passage describes Mr. Darcy's reaction to Miss Bingley's surprise at his admiration for Miss Elizabeth Bennet. He explains that a woman's imagination is very rapid, and that he knew she would be wishing him joy. Miss Bingley then declares that the matter is settled, and that Mr. Darcy will have a charming mother-in-law. The passage describes the excitement of two young women at the arrival of a militia regiment in their neighborhood. They learn the officers' names and connections and visit them often. Mr. Bennet tells his wife that he thinks their two youngest daughters are uncommonly foolish, and Mrs. Bennet responds that he should not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother. Miss Bingley sends a note to Miss Bennet, asking her to come have dinner so they can avoid quarrelling. The passage describes Mrs. Bennet's happiness at the prospect of her daughter, Jane, being stranded at the home of her wealthy suitor, Mr. Bingley, due to bad weather.\n\nLast chunk: with       the officers.\u2014Yours ever,        \u201cCAROLINE BINGLEY\u201d        \u201cWith the officers!\u201d cried Lydia. \u201cI wonder my aunt did not tell       us of _that_.\u201d        \u201cDining out,\u201d said Mrs. Bennet, \u201cthat is very unlucky.\u201d        \u201cCan I have the carriage?\u201d said Jane.        \u201cNo, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems       likely to rain; and then you must stay all night.\u201d        \u201cThat would be a good scheme,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cif you were sure       that they would not offer to send her home.\u201d        \u201cOh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley\u2019s chaise to go to       Meryton; and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.\u201d        \u201cI had much rather go in the coach.\u201d        \u201cBut, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure.

Jane was therefore obliged to go on       horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many       cheerful prognostics of a bad day. Her hopes were answered; Jane       had not been gone long before it rained hard. Her sisters were       uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted. The rain continued       the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly could not       come back.\n\nNext chunk:", "completion": " \u201cThis was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!\u201d said Mrs. Bennet, more       than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.

The passage describes Mr. Bennet's reaction to his wife's suggestion that they visit Mr. Bingley, a wealthy single man who is moving into the neighborhood. Mr. Bennet is not interested in meeting Mr. Bingley, but his wife insists that they do so. Mr. Bennet is over scrupulous and is preventing Mr. Bingley from marrying one of his daughters. He is concerned that they are all silly and ignorant, but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters. Mr. Bennet is an odd mixture of quick wit, sarcasm, and caprice, something his wife has not been able to understand fully after 23 years. Mrs. Bennet is a woman of low intelligence and bad temper. Their main goal in life is to get their daughters married off. When Mr. Bennet unexpectedly announces he is going to visit Mr. Bingley, Elizabeth is the only one who knows why. The passage discusses Mr. Bingley and whether or not he will be introduced to Mrs. Long. It is concluded that Mrs. Bennet will not do the introducing because she does not know him well enough herself. The girls' father will take it upon himself to decline Mr. Bingley's acquaintance after Mrs. Bennet declares she is sick of him. The passage describes Mr. Bennet's reaction to his wife's news that their girls had met a new young man. He is pleased and amused, and predicts that the man will soon be asking one of them to dance. His wife and daughters then try to get more information about him from Mr. Bennet, but he is evasive. Lady Lucas reports that Bingley is young, handsome, and agreeable, and that he plans to attend the next assembly with a large party. Mrs. Bennet is pleased at the prospect of one of her daughters marrying Bingley, and an invitation to dinner is dispatched. However, Bingley must go to town the following day and is unable to accept.

He is concerned that they are all silly and ignorant, but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters. Mr. Bennet is an odd mixture of quick wit, sarcasm, and caprice, something his wife has not been able to understand fully after 23 years. Mrs. Bennet is a woman of low intelligence and bad temper. Their main goal in life is to get their daughters married off. When Mr. Bennet unexpectedly announces he is going to visit Mr. Bingley, Elizabeth is the only one who knows why. The passage discusses Mr. Bingley and whether or not he will be introduced to Mrs. Long. It is concluded that Mrs. Bennet will not do the introducing because she does not know him well enough herself. The girls' father will take it upon himself to decline Mr. Bingley's acquaintance after Mrs. Bennet declares she is sick of him. The passage describes Mr. Bennet's reaction to his wife's news that their girls had met a new young man. He is pleased and amused, and predicts that the man will soon be asking one of them to dance. His wife and daughters then try to get more information about him from Mr. Bennet, but he is evasive. Lady Lucas reports that Bingley is young, handsome, and agreeable, and that he plans to attend the next assembly with a large party. Mrs. Bennet is pleased at the prospect of one of her daughters marrying Bingley, and an invitation to dinner is dispatched. However, Bingley must go to town the following day and is unable to accept. Mr. Bingley arrives in Hertfordshire and is quickly followed by rumors that he is bringing a large party of twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the ball. Upon his arrival, it is revealed that he has only brought six people with him. Mr. Bingley is a good-looking man with easy manners, while his sisters are fashionable women. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, looks like a gentleman, and his friend Mr. Darcy is a tall and handsome man who quickly catches the attention of the room. Mr. Darcy is a wealthy man who is considered to be very handsome, but he is also very proud and arrogant. He spends most of the evening at a ball walking around the room, and people hope he will not return. Mrs. Bennet is one of the people who strongly dislikes him. The passage describes Mr. Darcy's conversation with Mr. Bingley about the Bennet sisters. Mr. Darcy is not interested in dancing with any of the Bennet sisters, but Mr. Bingley finds them all very pleasant and pretty. Mr. Darcy is rude to Elizabeth and she is not pleased. Mr. Bennet is up late, reading, when his wife comes home from a ball. She reports that Jane was much admired and danced twice with Mr. Bingley. Mr. Bennet is pleased to hear this. Mrs. Bennet is delighted with Mr. Bingley, who she thinks is very handsome, and his sisters, who she thinks are charming women. However, she cannot stand Mr. Darcy, who she thinks is a very disagreeable, conceited man. Jane agrees with her mother about Mr. Bingley, and expresses admiration for him. This passage discusses Elizabeth's surprise at being complimented by a young man, and her friend's observations about her tendency to see the good in everyone. The passage describes the sisters of a man that the speaker likes. The speaker thinks they are proud and conceited, but notes that they are still pleasant to talk to. Mr. Bingley inherited property from his father and intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it. His sisters were very anxious for him to have an estate of his own. Mr. Bingley was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House and took it immediately. Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of great opposition of character. Darcy and Bingley have very different opinions of the people they meet at the Meryton assembly. Bingley find everyone pleasant and pretty, while Darcy finds them uninteresting and unattractive. The passage describes the family of Sir William Lucas, who lived near the Bennets and with whom they were close friends. Lady Lucas was a kind woman, and their eldest daughter was a sensible young woman whom Elizabeth liked. The Miss Lucases and Miss Bennets meet to discuss a ball, and Mrs. Bennet mentions that Mr. Bingley seemed to prefer Jane to any of the other girls. Charlotte then tells her about overhearing a conversation between Mr. Darcy and Mr. Robinson, in which Mr. Darcy says that Jane is the prettiest girl in the room. This passage discusses Mr. Darcy's perceived rudeness at a ball, with Miss Bingley claiming he is much more agreeable among his intimates. Mrs. Long says he said nothing to her at the ball, and Jane speculates that it may be because Mrs. Long does not have a carriage. Miss Lucas says she would not mind if he did not talk to her, but she wishes he had danced with Elizabeth. The passage discusses pride and how it is often mistaken for vanity. Pride is a feeling of self-satisfaction, while vanity is caring what others think of us. The passage also includes a conversation between Mrs. Bennet and her son Lucas, in which Lucas says he would drink a bottle of wine every day if he were as rich as Mr. Darcy. Mrs. Bennet tells him that if she saw him doing that, she would take away his bottle. The ladies of Longbourn visit the ladies of Netherfield, and it is evident that Mr. Bingley admires Jane. Jane is pleased by this, and Miss Lucas agrees that it is a good thing that Jane is not likely to be suspected by the world of being in love. The passage discusses how women should act around the men they are interested in. It is better for a woman to show more interest than she actually feels, as this will give the man encouragement. The passage discusses a plan for Jane to marry a rich husband, and Elizabeth agrees that it is a good idea if that is what Jane wants. However, Elizabeth points out that Jane does not yet know enough about the man to be certain of her feelings. Charlotte wishes Jane well. This passage discusses the idea that happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. The author argues that it is better to know as little as possible about the defects of the person you are going to spend your life with. The author also observes that Mr. Darcy, who initially thought Elizabeth was not pretty, began to find her more attractive after he realized that she was intelligent and had expressive eyes. Mr. Darcy begins to take notice of a woman who he previously thought to be uninteresting. He admires her figure and her playful demeanor, and starts to wish he knew more about her. When he overhears her talking to a friend, he is amused by her impertinence and decides to speak to her. The lady in the passage is reluctant to play and sing for others, but does so anyway. Her sister Mary is eager to display her own talents and takes over the instrument after a few songs. The passage describes a group of people dancing at a party. Mr. Darcy is standing near them, looking disapproving. Sir William Lucas comments on how much he enjoys dancing, and Mr. Darcy agrees that it is a pleasant activity.

Darcy is hesitant, but Sir William persists and eventually Darcy agrees. Elizabeth, however, is not interested in dancing with Darcy and quickly turns him down.

Miss Bingley is jealous and tries to find out what Darcy is thinking about, but he insists he was thinking about something else entirely. The passage describes Mr. Darcy's reaction to Miss Bingley's surprise at his admiration for Miss Elizabeth Bennet. He explains that a woman's imagination is very rapid, and that he knew she would be wishing him joy. Miss Bingley then declares that the matter is settled, and that Mr. Darcy will have a charming mother-in-law. The passage describes the excitement of two young women at the arrival of a militia regiment in their neighborhood. They learn the officers' names and connections and visit them often. Mr. Bennet tells his wife that he thinks their two youngest daughters are uncommonly foolish, and Mrs. Bennet responds that he should not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother. Miss Bingley sends a note to Miss Bennet, asking her to come have dinner so they can avoid quarrelling. The passage describes Mrs. Bennet's happiness at the prospect of her daughter, Jane, being stranded at the home of her wealthy suitor, Mr. Bingley, due to bad weather. Mrs. Bennet is happy that her plan to make it rain has worked, as it will keep Elizabeth at Netherfield with Mr. Bingley. However, Mr. Bennet jokingly says that he only hopes Elizabeth does not become seriously ill or die as a result of the cold weather. Elizabeth is worried about her sister and decides to walk to Netherfield to check on her, even though she does not know how to ride a horse. Elizabeth is walking to Meryton when she is joined by her sisters Catherine and Lydia. They walk quickly and eventually part ways, with Elizabeth continuing on alone. She arrives at her destination with tired feet and a face flushed from the exercise.\n\nLast chunk: alternative.

The passage describes Mr. Bennet's reaction to his wife's suggestion that they visit Mr. Bingley, a wealthy single man who is moving into the neighborhood. Mr. Bennet is not interested in meeting Mr. Bingley, but his wife insists that they do so. Mr. Bennet is over scrupulous and is preventing Mr. Bingley from marrying one of his daughters. He is concerned that they are all silly and ignorant, but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters. Mr. Bennet is an odd mixture of quick wit, sarcasm, and caprice, something his wife has not been able to understand fully after 23 years. Mrs. Bennet is a woman of low intelligence and bad temper. Their main goal in life is to get their daughters married off. When Mr. Bennet unexpectedly announces he is going to visit Mr. Bingley, Elizabeth is the only one who knows why. The passage discusses Mr. Bingley and whether or not he will be introduced to Mrs. Long. It is concluded that Mrs. Bennet will not do the introducing because she does not know him well enough herself. The girls' father will take it upon himself to decline Mr. Bingley's acquaintance after Mrs. Bennet declares she is sick of him. The passage describes Mr. Bennet's reaction to his wife's news that their girls had met a new young man. He is pleased and amused, and predicts that the man will soon be asking one of them to dance. His wife and daughters then try to get more information about him from Mr. Bennet, but he is evasive. Lady Lucas reports that Bingley is young, handsome, and agreeable, and that he plans to attend the next assembly with a large party. Mrs. Bennet is pleased at the prospect of one of her daughters marrying Bingley, and an invitation to dinner is dispatched. However, Bingley must go to town the following day and is unable to accept. Mr. Bingley arrives in Hertfordshire and is quickly followed by rumors that he is bringing a large party of twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the ball. Upon his arrival, it is revealed that he has only brought six people with him. Mr. Bingley is a good-looking man with easy manners, while his sisters are fashionable women. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, looks like a gentleman, and his friend Mr. Darcy is a tall and handsome man who quickly catches the attention of the room. Mr. Darcy is a wealthy man who is considered to be very handsome, but he is also very proud and arrogant. He spends most of the evening at a ball walking around the room, and people hope he will not return. Mrs. Bennet is one of the people who strongly dislikes him. The passage describes Mr. Darcy's conversation with Mr. Bingley about the Bennet sisters. Mr. Darcy is not interested in dancing with any of the Bennet sisters, but Mr. Bingley finds them all very pleasant and pretty. Mr. Darcy is rude to Elizabeth and she is not pleased. Mr. Bennet is up late, reading, when his wife comes home from a ball. She reports that Jane was much admired and danced twice with Mr. Bingley. Mr. Bennet is pleased to hear this. Mrs. Bennet is delighted with Mr. Bingley, who she thinks is very handsome, and his sisters, who she thinks are charming women. However, she cannot stand Mr. Darcy, who she thinks is a very disagreeable, conceited man. Jane agrees with her mother about Mr. Bingley, and expresses admiration for him. This passage discusses Elizabeth's surprise at being complimented by a young man, and her friend's observations about her tendency to see the good in everyone. The passage describes the sisters of a man that the speaker likes. The speaker thinks they are proud and conceited, but notes that they are still pleasant to talk to. Mr. Bingley inherited property from his father and intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it. His sisters were very anxious for him to have an estate of his own. Mr. Bingley was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House and took it immediately. Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of great opposition of character. Darcy and Bingley have very different opinions of the people they meet at the Meryton assembly. Bingley find everyone pleasant and pretty, while Darcy finds them uninteresting and unattractive. The passage describes the family of Sir William Lucas, who lived near the Bennets and with whom they were close friends. Lady Lucas was a kind woman, and their eldest daughter was a sensible young woman whom Elizabeth liked. The Miss Lucases and Miss Bennets meet to discuss a ball, and Mrs. Bennet mentions that Mr. Bingley seemed to prefer Jane to any of the other girls. Charlotte then tells her about overhearing a conversation between Mr. Darcy and Mr. Robinson, in which Mr. Darcy says that Jane is the prettiest girl in the room. This passage discusses Mr. Darcy's perceived rudeness at a ball, with Miss Bingley claiming he is much more agreeable among his intimates. Mrs. Long says he said nothing to her at the ball, and Jane speculates that it may be because Mrs. Long does not have a carriage. Miss Lucas says she would not mind if he did not talk to her, but she wishes he had danced with Elizabeth. The passage discusses pride and how it is often mistaken for vanity. Pride is a feeling of self-satisfaction, while vanity is caring what others think of us. The passage also includes a conversation between Mrs. Bennet and her son Lucas, in which Lucas says he would drink a bottle of wine every day if he were as rich as Mr. Darcy. Mrs. Bennet tells him that if she saw him doing that, she would take away his bottle. The ladies of Longbourn visit the ladies of Netherfield, and it is evident that Mr. Bingley admires Jane. Jane is pleased by this, and Miss Lucas agrees that it is a good thing that Jane is not likely to be suspected by the world of being in love. The passage discusses how women should act around the men they are interested in. It is better for a woman to show more interest than she actually feels, as this will give the man encouragement. The passage discusses a plan for Jane to marry a rich husband, and Elizabeth agrees that it is a good idea if that is what Jane wants. However, Elizabeth points out that Jane does not yet know enough about the man to be certain of her feelings. Charlotte wishes Jane well. This passage discusses the idea that happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. The author argues that it is better to know as little as possible about the defects of the person you are going to spend your life with. The author also observes that Mr. Darcy, who initially thought Elizabeth was not pretty, began to find her more attractive after he realized that she was intelligent and had expressive eyes. Mr. Darcy begins to take notice of a woman who he previously thought to be uninteresting. He admires her figure and her playful demeanor, and starts to wish he knew more about her. When he overhears her talking to a friend, he is amused by her impertinence and decides to speak to her. The lady in the passage is reluctant to play and sing for others, but does so anyway. Her sister Mary is eager to display her own talents and takes over the instrument after a few songs. The passage describes a group of people dancing at a party. Mr. Darcy is standing near them, looking disapproving. Sir William Lucas comments on how much he enjoys dancing, and Mr. Darcy agrees that it is a pleasant activity. This passage describes a conversation between Mr. Darcy and Sir William, in which Sir William tries to convince Darcy to dance with Elizabeth. Darcy is hesitant, but Sir William persists and eventually Darcy agrees. Elizabeth, however, is not interested in dancing with Darcy and quickly turns him down. The passage describes a conversation between Mr. Darcy and Miss Bingley in which Darcy compliments Elizabeth's dancing. Miss Bingley is jealous and tries to find out what Darcy is thinking about, but he insists he was thinking about something else entirely. The passage describes Mr. Darcy's reaction to Miss Bingley's surprise at his admiration for Miss Elizabeth Bennet. He explains that a woman's imagination is very rapid, and that he knew she would be wishing him joy. Miss Bingley then declares that the matter is settled, and that Mr. Darcy will have a charming mother-in-law. The passage describes the excitement of two young women at the arrival of a militia regiment in their neighborhood. They learn the officers' names and connections and visit them often. Mr. Bennet tells his wife that he thinks their two youngest daughters are uncommonly foolish, and Mrs. Bennet responds that he should not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother. Miss Bingley sends a note to Miss Bennet, asking her to come have dinner so they can avoid quarrelling. The passage describes Mrs. Bennet's happiness at the prospect of her daughter, Jane, being stranded at the home of her wealthy suitor, Mr. Bingley, due to bad weather. Mrs. Bennet is happy that her plan to make it rain has worked, as it will keep Elizabeth at Netherfield with Mr. Bingley. However, Mr. Bennet jokingly says that he only hopes Elizabeth does not become seriously ill or die as a result of the cold weather. Elizabeth is worried about her sister and decides to walk to Netherfield to check on her, even though she does not know how to ride a horse. Elizabeth is walking to Meryton when she is joined by her sisters Catherine and Lydia. They walk quickly and eventually part ways, with Elizabeth continuing on alone. She arrives at her destination with tired feet and a face flushed from the exercise. Elizabeth is surprised to find Jane at breakfast with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, who seem to disapprove of her having walked three miles in the cold. Mr. Darcy and Mr. Hurst are also there. Elizabeth enquires after her sister and is taken to see her immediately. Jane is delighted to see her but is too ill to speak much. The passage describes Elizabeth's reaction to seeing her sister Jane being treated for a cold by the apothecary. Elizabeth stays with her sister at Netherfield and is joined by the other sisters. The family is notified of her stay and a servant is sent to Longbourn to bring back clothes.\n\nLast chunk: treated with. Elizabeth silently attended her.        When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and       Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much       affection and solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary       came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be       supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must       endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed,       and promised her some draughts. The advice was followed readily,       for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely.       Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were the other       ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact       nothing to do elsewhere.        When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and       very unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage,       and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane       testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was       obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to       remain at Netherfield for the present. Elizabeth most thankfully       consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint       the family with her stay, and bring back a supply of clothes.     Chapter 8        At five o\u2019clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past       six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil enquiries       which\n\nNext chunk:", "completion": " then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of       distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley\u2019s, she       could not make a very favourable answer. Jane was by no means       better. The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four       times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a       bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves;       and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference       towards Jane when not immediately before them, restored Elizabeth       to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.        Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she       could regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was       evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they       prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed       she was considered by the others. She had very little notice from       any but him. Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister       scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he       was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at       cards; who, when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout,       had nothing to say to her.        When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss       Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her       manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride       and impertinence;"}

He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.  His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.  \u201cWedlock suits you,\u201d he remarked. \u201cI think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.\u201d  \u201cSeven!\u201d I answered.  \u201cIndeed, I should have thought a little more.

Holmes and Watson go to India to try to find out what happened to Neville \n13. They meet with Neville's old friend, Colonel Sebastian Moran, who tells them that Neville was involved in a very strange incident while he was in India \n14. Moran tells them that Neville was part of a group of British soldiers who were attacked by a group of native Indians \n15. The Indians were led by a man called the Maharaja, who was a very powerful magician \n16. The Maharaja put a spell on Neville and the other soldiers, which made them all very ill \n17.

He respected her for her intelligence and ability to read people, but their relationship was never romantic. Sherlock Holmes is still living in Baker Street and is still interested in crime. Watson sees him one night and they catch up. Sherlock Holmes deduces that Watson has gained weight and gone into practice again, based on his appearance. The passage describes how Sherlock Holmes deduces various things about a person based on their appearance. He explains that it is simple to do once you know how, but that most people are baffled by the process. A man receives a note asking him to meet a masked visitor at 8:15 to discuss a matter of great importance. The man has no idea what the meeting could be about. The passage discusses a note written on paper that is strong and stiff, with a peculiar texture. The paper is from Bohemia, and the note was written by someone who is likely well-to-do. A man enters who is very tall with a muscular build. He is richly dressed. A man wearing a mask enters and Holmes deduces that he is from Bohemia. The man introduces himself as the Count Von Kramm. A man who wishes to remain anonymous visits Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, asking them to swear to secrecy for two years and promising that at the end of that time, the matter will be of no importance. The man explains that the matter involves the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia, and that it has the potential to grow into a scandal that could seriously damage the family's reputation. The passage describes a meeting between Sherlock Holmes and a man who later reveals himself to be the King of Bohemia. The King explains that he is seeking Holmes's help in a delicate matter concerning a woman named Irene Adler. The King of Bohemia has hired Sherlock Holmes to retrieve some compromising letters that he wrote to a young woman. However, the woman refuses to sell them or return them, and several attempts to steal them have failed. The speaker's employer has been threatened by Irene Adler, who has a compromising photograph of the employer. Adler has said she will send the photograph to the employer's fianc\u00e9e's family unless the employer breaks off the engagement.

I will tell you, however. I left the house a little after eight o\u2019clock this morning in the character of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all that there is to know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It is a _bijou_ villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room on the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor, and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting anything else of interest.  \u201cI then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in exchange twopence, a glass of half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco, and as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to listen to.\u201d  \u201cAnd what of Irene Adler?\u201d I asked.  \u201cOh, she has turned all the men\u2019s heads\n\nNext chunk:", "completion": " down in that part.

They meet with Neville's old friend, Colonel Sebastian Moran, who tells them that Neville was involved in a very strange incident while he was in India \n14. Moran tells them that Neville was part of a group of British soldiers who were attacked by a group of native Indians \n15.

He respected her for her intelligence and ability to read people, but their relationship was never romantic. Sherlock Holmes is still living in Baker Street and is still interested in crime. Watson sees him one night and they catch up. Sherlock Holmes deduces that Watson has gained weight and gone into practice again, based on his appearance. The passage describes how Sherlock Holmes deduces various things about a person based on their appearance. He explains that it is simple to do once you know how, but that most people are baffled by the process. A man receives a note asking him to meet a masked visitor at 8:15 to discuss a matter of great importance. The man has no idea what the meeting could be about. The passage discusses a note written on paper that is strong and stiff, with a peculiar texture. The paper is from Bohemia, and the note was written by someone who is likely well-to-do. A man enters who is very tall with a muscular build. He is richly dressed. A man wearing a mask enters and Holmes deduces that he is from Bohemia. The man introduces himself as the Count Von Kramm. A man who wishes to remain anonymous visits Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, asking them to swear to secrecy for two years and promising that at the end of that time, the matter will be of no importance. The man explains that the matter involves the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia, and that it has the potential to grow into a scandal that could seriously damage the family's reputation. The passage describes a meeting between Sherlock Holmes and a man who later reveals himself to be the King of Bohemia. The King explains that he is seeking Holmes's help in a delicate matter concerning a woman named Irene Adler. The King of Bohemia has hired Sherlock Holmes to retrieve some compromising letters that he wrote to a young woman. However, the woman refuses to sell them or return them, and several attempts to steal them have failed. The speaker's employer has been threatened by Irene Adler, who has a compromising photograph of the employer. Adler has said she will send the photograph to the employer's fianc\u00e9e's family unless the employer breaks off the engagement. The speaker is sure that Adler has not sent the photograph yet, because she said she would do so on the day the engagement is publicly announced (next Monday). Holmes is hired by a king to find a missing photograph. He is given a large sum of money and the address of the person who has it. He plans to meet with Watson the next day to discuss the case. The speaker describes how Sherlock Holmes was able to transform himself from a drunken-looking groom into a respectable tweed-suited man. He notes that this was just one of Holmes's many amazing abilities with disguises. The speaker then recounts how Holmes spent his morning and what he did at the end of it. The narrator, in the guise of a groom out of work, observed the habits and home of Miss Irene Adler. He learned from the local stable hands that she had turned the heads of all the local men. A woman who lives quietly and sings at concerts is the subject of gossip among cab drivers. They know that she has a male visitor who is a lawyer, and they speculate about the nature of their relationship. The narrator is trying to decide whether to investigate the woman or the man. A hansom cab pulls up to Briony Lodge and a gentleman emerges. He is in a hurry and appears to be the man of whom the narrator has heard. He goes into the house and the narrator sees him through the window, pacing and talking excitedly. He comes out and gets into the cab, telling the driver to hurry. The driver of a landau pulls up and a woman gets in, telling him to hurry to the Church of St. Monica. A man is being chased by two people, one of whom is Irene Adler.

He respected her for her intelligence and ability to read people, but their relationship was never romantic. Sherlock Holmes is still living in Baker Street and is still interested in crime. Watson sees him one night and they catch up. Sherlock Holmes deduces that Watson has gained weight and gone into practice again, based on his appearance. The passage describes how Sherlock Holmes deduces various things about a person based on their appearance. He explains that it is simple to do once you know how, but that most people are baffled by the process. A man receives a note asking him to meet a masked visitor at 8:15 to discuss a matter of great importance. The man has no idea what the meeting could be about. The passage discusses a note written on paper that is strong and stiff, with a peculiar texture. The paper is from Bohemia, and the note was written by someone who is likely well-to-do. A man enters who is very tall with a muscular build. He is richly dressed. A man wearing a mask enters and Holmes deduces that he is from Bohemia. The man introduces himself as the Count Von Kramm. A man who wishes to remain anonymous visits Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, asking them to swear to secrecy for two years and promising that at the end of that time, the matter will be of no importance. The man explains that the matter involves the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia, and that it has the potential to grow into a scandal that could seriously damage the family's reputation. The passage describes a meeting between Sherlock Holmes and a man who later reveals himself to be the King of Bohemia. The King explains that he is seeking Holmes's help in a delicate matter concerning a woman named Irene Adler. The King of Bohemia has hired Sherlock Holmes to retrieve some compromising letters that he wrote to a young woman. However, the woman refuses to sell them or return them, and several attempts to steal them have failed. The speaker's employer has been threatened by Irene Adler, who has a compromising photograph of the employer. Adler has said she will send the photograph to the employer's fianc\u00e9e's family unless the employer breaks off the engagement. The speaker is sure that Adler has not sent the photograph yet, because she said she would do so on the day the engagement is publicly announced (next Monday). Holmes is hired by a king to find a missing photograph. He is given a large sum of money and the address of the person who has it. He plans to meet with Watson the next day to discuss the case. The speaker describes how Sherlock Holmes was able to transform himself from a drunken-looking groom into a respectable tweed-suited man. He notes that this was just one of Holmes's many amazing abilities with disguises. The speaker then recounts how Holmes spent his morning and what he did at the end of it. The narrator, in the guise of a groom out of work, observed the habits and home of Miss Irene Adler. He learned from the local stable hands that she had turned the heads of all the local men. A woman who lives quietly and sings at concerts is the subject of gossip among cab drivers. They know that she has a male visitor who is a lawyer, and they speculate about the nature of their relationship. The narrator is trying to decide whether to investigate the woman or the man. A hansom cab pulls up to Briony Lodge and a gentleman emerges. He is in a hurry and appears to be the man of whom the narrator has heard. He goes into the house and the narrator sees him through the window, pacing and talking excitedly. He comes out and gets into the cab, telling the driver to hurry. The driver of a landau pulls up and a woman gets in, telling him to hurry to the Church of St. Monica. A man is being chased by two people, one of whom is Irene Adler.

Watson sees him one night and they catch up. Sherlock Holmes deduces that Watson has gained weight and gone into practice again, based on his appearance. The passage describes how Sherlock Holmes deduces various things about a person based on their appearance. He explains that it is simple to do once you know how, but that most people are baffled by the process. A man receives a note asking him to meet a masked visitor at 8:15 to discuss a matter of great importance. The man has no idea what the meeting could be about. The passage discusses a note written on paper that is strong and stiff, with a peculiar texture. The paper is from Bohemia, and the note was written by someone who is likely well-to-do. A man enters who is very tall with a muscular build. He is richly dressed. A man wearing a mask enters and Holmes deduces that he is from Bohemia. The man introduces himself as the Count Von Kramm. A man who wishes to remain anonymous visits Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, asking them to swear to secrecy for two years and promising that at the end of that time, the matter will be of no importance. The man explains that the matter involves the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia, and that it has the potential to grow into a scandal that could seriously damage the family's reputation. The passage describes a meeting between Sherlock Holmes and a man who later reveals himself to be the King of Bohemia. The King explains that he is seeking Holmes's help in a delicate matter concerning a woman named Irene Adler. The King of Bohemia has hired Sherlock Holmes to retrieve some compromising letters that he wrote to a young woman. However, the woman refuses to sell them or return them, and several attempts to steal them have failed. The speaker's employer has been threatened by Irene Adler, who has a compromising photograph of the employer. Adler has said she will send the photograph to the employer's fianc\u00e9e's family unless the employer breaks off the engagement. The speaker is sure that Adler has not sent the photograph yet, because she said she would do so on the day the engagement is publicly announced (next Monday). Holmes is hired by a king to find a missing photograph. He is given a large sum of money and the address of the person who has it. He plans to meet with Watson the next day to discuss the case. The speaker describes how Sherlock Holmes was able to transform himself from a drunken-looking groom into a respectable tweed-suited man. He notes that this was just one of Holmes's many amazing abilities with disguises. The speaker then recounts how Holmes spent his morning and what he did at the end of it. The narrator, in the guise of a groom out of work, observed the habits and home of Miss Irene Adler. He learned from the local stable hands that she had turned the heads of all the local men. A woman who lives quietly and sings at concerts is the subject of gossip among cab drivers. They know that she has a male visitor who is a lawyer, and they speculate about the nature of their relationship. The narrator is trying to decide whether to investigate the woman or the man. A hansom cab pulls up to Briony Lodge and a gentleman emerges. He is in a hurry and appears to be the man of whom the narrator has heard. He goes into the house and the narrator sees him through the window, pacing and talking excitedly. He comes out and gets into the cab, telling the driver to hurry. The driver of a landau pulls up and a woman gets in, telling him to hurry to the Church of St. Monica. A man is being chased by two people, one of whom is Irene Adler. He escapes by getting into a cab and telling the driver to take him to the Church of St. Monica. He arrives just in time to see Adler and the other person getting married.

He respected her for her intelligence and ability to read people, but their relationship was never romantic. Sherlock Holmes is still living in Baker Street and is still interested in crime. Watson sees him one night and they catch up. Sherlock Holmes deduces that Watson has gained weight and gone into practice again, based on his appearance. The passage describes how Sherlock Holmes deduces various things about a person based on their appearance. He explains that it is simple to do once you know how, but that most people are baffled by the process. A man receives a note asking him to meet a masked visitor at 8:15 to discuss a matter of great importance. The man has no idea what the meeting could be about. The passage discusses a note written on paper that is strong and stiff, with a peculiar texture. The paper is from Bohemia, and the note was written by someone who is likely well-to-do. A man enters who is very tall with a muscular build. He is richly dressed. A man wearing a mask enters and Holmes deduces that he is from Bohemia. The man introduces himself as the Count Von Kramm. A man who wishes to remain anonymous visits Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, asking them to swear to secrecy for two years and promising that at the end of that time, the matter will be of no importance. The man explains that the matter involves the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia, and that it has the potential to grow into a scandal that could seriously damage the family's reputation. The passage describes a meeting between Sherlock Holmes and a man who later reveals himself to be the King of Bohemia. The King explains that he is seeking Holmes's help in a delicate matter concerning a woman named Irene Adler. The King of Bohemia has hired Sherlock Holmes to retrieve some compromising letters that he wrote to a young woman. However, the woman refuses to sell them or return them, and several attempts to steal them have failed. The speaker's employer has been threatened by Irene Adler, who has a compromising photograph of the employer. Adler has said she will send the photograph to the employer's fianc\u00e9e's family unless the employer breaks off the engagement. The speaker is sure that Adler has not sent the photograph yet, because she said she would do so on the day the engagement is publicly announced (next Monday). Holmes is hired by a king to find a missing photograph. He is given a large sum of money and the address of the person who has it. He plans to meet with Watson the next day to discuss the case. The speaker describes how Sherlock Holmes was able to transform himself from a drunken-looking groom into a respectable tweed-suited man. He notes that this was just one of Holmes's many amazing abilities with disguises. The speaker then recounts how Holmes spent his morning and what he did at the end of it. The narrator, in the guise of a groom out of work, observed the habits and home of Miss Irene Adler. He learned from the local stable hands that she had turned the heads of all the local men. A woman who lives quietly and sings at concerts is the subject of gossip among cab drivers. They know that she has a male visitor who is a lawyer, and they speculate about the nature of their relationship. The narrator is trying to decide whether to investigate the woman or the man. A hansom cab pulls up to Briony Lodge and a gentleman emerges. He is in a hurry and appears to be the man of whom the narrator has heard. He goes into the house and the narrator sees him through the window, pacing and talking excitedly. He comes out and gets into the cab, telling the driver to hurry. The driver of a landau pulls up and a woman gets in, telling him to hurry to the Church of St. Monica. A man is being chased by two people, one of whom is Irene Adler. He escapes by getting into a cab and telling the driver to take him to the Church of St. Monica. He arrives just in time to see Adler and the other person getting married.

The man then says that he needs to make his own arrangements, which are cold beef and a glass of beer. The speaker is telling the person they are speaking to that they must not interfere in what is about to happen, and that they will know what to do when the time comes. Holmes and Watson are planning to use a fire as a distraction to break into a house. Holmes will pose as a clergyman, and Watson will wait for his signal to throw an object through the window and raise the alarm. The passage describes the scene around a house, and Holmes observes that the recent marriage of the occupants makes the search for a photograph more complicated. He reasons that the woman most likely has the photograph in her own possession, rather than with her banker or lawyer. A lady steps out of her carriage and is immediately surrounded by a group of men who start fighting with each other. One of the men is Holmes, who is trying to protect the lady. He gets hit and falls to the ground. Irene Adler helps an injured man, even though she is being watched by Sherlock Holmes, who is trying to blackmail her. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson set off a smoke bomb in order to distract a crowd and allow them to escape. A man is pretending to be injured and is carried into a woman's home. He knows she will try to save her most precious belongings in a fire, so he starts a fire and she grabs the photograph he is looking for.

However, the woman refuses to sell them or return them, and several attempts to steal them have failed. The speaker's employer has been threatened by Irene Adler, who has a compromising photograph of the employer. Adler has said she will send the photograph to the employer's fianc\u00e9e's family unless the employer breaks off the engagement. The speaker is sure that Adler has not sent the photograph yet, because she said she would do so on the day the engagement is publicly announced (next Monday). Holmes is hired by a king to find a missing photograph. He is given a large sum of money and the address of the person who has it. He plans to meet with Watson the next day to discuss the case. The speaker describes how Sherlock Holmes was able to transform himself from a drunken-looking groom into a respectable tweed-suited man. He notes that this was just one of Holmes's many amazing abilities with disguises. The speaker then recounts how Holmes spent his morning and what he did at the end of it. The narrator, in the guise of a groom out of work, observed the habits and home of Miss Irene Adler. He learned from the local stable hands that she had turned the heads of all the local men. A woman who lives quietly and sings at concerts is the subject of gossip among cab drivers. They know that she has a male visitor who is a lawyer, and they speculate about the nature of their relationship. The narrator is trying to decide whether to investigate the woman or the man. A hansom cab pulls up to Briony Lodge and a gentleman emerges. He is in a hurry and appears to be the man of whom the narrator has heard. He goes into the house and the narrator sees him through the window, pacing and talking excitedly. He comes out and gets into the cab, telling the driver to hurry. The driver of a landau pulls up and a woman gets in, telling him to hurry to the Church of St. Monica. A man is being chased by two people, one of whom is Irene Adler. He escapes by getting into a cab and telling the driver to take him to the Church of St. Monica. He arrives just in time to see Adler and the other person getting married. The passage describes a man's encounter with a couple who were about to be married. The man ended up being their witness, and the bride gave him a sovereign. The man then says that he needs to make his own arrangements, which are cold beef and a glass of beer. The speaker is telling the person they are speaking to that they must not interfere in what is about to happen, and that they will know what to do when the time comes. Holmes and Watson are planning to use a fire as a distraction to break into a house. Holmes will pose as a clergyman, and Watson will wait for his signal to throw an object through the window and raise the alarm. The passage describes the scene around a house, and Holmes observes that the recent marriage of the occupants makes the search for a photograph more complicated. He reasons that the woman most likely has the photograph in her own possession, rather than with her banker or lawyer. A lady steps out of her carriage and is immediately surrounded by a group of men who start fighting with each other. One of the men is Holmes, who is trying to protect the lady. He gets hit and falls to the ground. Irene Adler helps an injured man, even though she is being watched by Sherlock Holmes, who is trying to blackmail her. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson set off a smoke bomb in order to distract a crowd and allow them to escape. A man is pretending to be injured and is carried into a woman's home. He knows she will try to save her most precious belongings in a fire, so he starts a fire and she grabs the photograph he is looking for. Someone has stolen a photograph from a house, and Sherlock Holmes is on the case. He and a companion will call on the house tomorrow morning to try to find the thief and retrieve the photograph. Irene Adler is married, and Sherlock Holmes is in hopes that she loves her husband, because it would spare the King of Bohemia all fear of future annoyance. The woman in the passage has left England, and the person she was speaking to (Sherlock Holmes) is surprised and disappointed. He had been hoping to get some information from her. Irene Adler is an actress who has masqueraded as a man before. She followed Sherlock Holmes to his home and then ran off to her husband. They are leaving because the king wronged them and they have a photograph to prove it.\n\nLast chunk: suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old     clergyman.

I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a     weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might     take in the future.

He respected her for her intelligence and ability to read people, but their relationship was never romantic. Sherlock Holmes is still living in Baker Street and is still interested in crime. Watson sees him one night and they catch up. Sherlock Holmes deduces that Watson has gained weight and gone into practice again, based on his appearance. The passage describes how Sherlock Holmes deduces various things about a person based on their appearance. He explains that it is simple to do once you know how, but that most people are baffled by the process. A man receives a note asking him to meet a masked visitor at 8:15 to discuss a matter of great importance. The man has no idea what the meeting could be about. The passage discusses a note written on paper that is strong and stiff, with a peculiar texture. The paper is from Bohemia, and the note was written by someone who is likely well-to-do. A man enters who is very tall with a muscular build. He is richly dressed. A man wearing a mask enters and Holmes deduces that he is from Bohemia. The man introduces himself as the Count Von Kramm. A man who wishes to remain anonymous visits Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, asking them to swear to secrecy for two years and promising that at the end of that time, the matter will be of no importance. The man explains that the matter involves the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia, and that it has the potential to grow into a scandal that could seriously damage the family's reputation. The passage describes a meeting between Sherlock Holmes and a man who later reveals himself to be the King of Bohemia. The King explains that he is seeking Holmes's help in a delicate matter concerning a woman named Irene Adler. The King of Bohemia has hired Sherlock Holmes to retrieve some compromising letters that he wrote to a young woman. However, the woman refuses to sell them or return them, and several attempts to steal them have failed. The speaker's employer has been threatened by Irene Adler, who has a compromising photograph of the employer. Adler has said she will send the photograph to the employer's fianc\u00e9e's family unless the employer breaks off the engagement. The speaker is sure that Adler has not sent the photograph yet, because she said she would do so on the day the engagement is publicly announced (next Monday). Holmes is hired by a king to find a missing photograph. He is given a large sum of money and the address of the person who has it. He plans to meet with Watson the next day to discuss the case. The speaker describes how Sherlock Holmes was able to transform himself from a drunken-looking groom into a respectable tweed-suited man. He notes that this was just one of Holmes's many amazing abilities with disguises. The speaker then recounts how Holmes spent his morning and what he did at the end of it. The narrator, in the guise of a groom out of work, observed the habits and home of Miss Irene Adler. He learned from the local stable hands that she had turned the heads of all the local men. A woman who lives quietly and sings at concerts is the subject of gossip among cab drivers. They know that she has a male visitor who is a lawyer, and they speculate about the nature of their relationship. The narrator is trying to decide whether to investigate the woman or the man. A hansom cab pulls up to Briony Lodge and a gentleman emerges. He is in a hurry and appears to be the man of whom the narrator has heard. He goes into the house and the narrator sees him through the window, pacing and talking excitedly. He comes out and gets into the cab, telling the driver to hurry. The driver of a landau pulls up and a woman gets in, telling him to hurry to the Church of St. Monica. A man is being chased by two people, one of whom is Irene Adler. He escapes by getting into a cab and telling the driver to take him to the Church of St. Monica. He arrives just in time to see Adler and the other person getting married. The passage describes a man's encounter with a couple who were about to be married. The man ended up being their witness, and the bride gave him a sovereign. The man then says that he needs to make his own arrangements, which are cold beef and a glass of beer. The speaker is telling the person they are speaking to that they must not interfere in what is about to happen, and that they will know what to do when the time comes. Holmes and Watson are planning to use a fire as a distraction to break into a house. Holmes will pose as a clergyman, and Watson will wait for his signal to throw an object through the window and raise the alarm. The passage describes the scene around a house, and Holmes observes that the recent marriage of the occupants makes the search for a photograph more complicated. He reasons that the woman most likely has the photograph in her own possession, rather than with her banker or lawyer. A lady steps out of her carriage and is immediately surrounded by a group of men who start fighting with each other. One of the men is Holmes, who is trying to protect the lady. He gets hit and falls to the ground. Irene Adler helps an injured man, even though she is being watched by Sherlock Holmes, who is trying to blackmail her. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson set off a smoke bomb in order to distract a crowd and allow them to escape. A man is pretending to be injured and is carried into a woman's home. He knows she will try to save her most precious belongings in a fire, so he starts a fire and she grabs the photograph he is looking for. Someone has stolen a photograph from a house, and Sherlock Holmes is on the case. He and a companion will call on the house tomorrow morning to try to find the thief and retrieve the photograph. Irene Adler is married, and Sherlock Holmes is in hopes that she loves her husband, because it would spare the King of Bohemia all fear of future annoyance. The woman in the passage has left England, and the person she was speaking to (Sherlock Holmes) is surprised and disappointed. He had been hoping to get some information from her. Irene Adler is an actress who has masqueraded as a man before. She followed Sherlock Holmes to his home and then ran off to her husband. They are leaving because the king wronged them and they have a photograph to prove it. In the passage, Holmes is discussing with the King how a woman's wit has bested his plans. He seems to be impressed by the woman, and the King offers to reward him. Holmes requests the woman's photograph, and the King agrees. In the autumn of last year, Sherlock Holmes was in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair. I was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me. The stout gentleman was Mr. Wilson, Holmes' partner and helper in many of his most successful cases. A man comes to Sherlock Holmes to tell him about a very strange series of events. It is not clear if a crime has been committed, but the story is very curious.\n\nLast chunk: the other day, just before we went into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination.\u201d  \u201cA proposition which I took the liberty of doubting.\u201d  \u201cYou did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which I have listened to for some time. You have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed. As far as I have heard, it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to. Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative. I ask you not merely because my friend Dr. Watson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips.

In the autumn of last year, Sherlock Holmes was in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair. I was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me. The stout gentleman was Mr. Wilson, Holmes' partner and helper in many of his most successful cases. A man comes to Sherlock Holmes to tell him about a very strange series of events. It is not clear if a crime has been committed, but the story is very curious. The passage describes a man who is seeking Sherlock Holmes' help. The man is average-looking, except for his red hair and disgruntled expression. Holmes deduces from the man's appearance that he has done manual labor at some point. The speaker uses Mr. Jabez Wilson's physical appearance to deduce that he is a manual laborer, a Freemason, and has recently been to China.\n\nLast chunk: takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else.\u201d  Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.  \u201cHow, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr. Holmes?\u201d he asked. \u201cHow did you know, for example, that I did manual labour.

I have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject. That trick of staining the fishes\u2019 scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China.

The eBook is updated regularly and is available in English. Sherlock Holmes was not a man who felt emotion, except for one woman: Irene Adler. He respected her for her intelligence and ability to read people, but their relationship was never romantic. Sherlock Holmes is still living in Baker Street and is still interested in crime. Watson sees him one night and they catch up. Sherlock Holmes deduces that Watson has gained weight and gone into practice again, based on his appearance. The passage describes how Sherlock Holmes deduces various things about a person based on their appearance. He explains that it is simple to do once you know how, but that most people are baffled by the process. A man receives a note asking him to meet a masked visitor at 8:15 to discuss a matter of great importance. The man has no idea what the meeting could be about. The passage discusses a note written on paper that is strong and stiff, with a peculiar texture. The paper is from Bohemia, and the note was written by someone who is likely well-to-do. A man enters who is very tall with a muscular build. He is richly dressed. A man wearing a mask enters and Holmes deduces that he is from Bohemia. The man introduces himself as the Count Von Kramm. A man who wishes to remain anonymous visits Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, asking them to swear to secrecy for two years and promising that at the end of that time, the matter will be of no importance. The man explains that the matter involves the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia, and that it has the potential to grow into a scandal that could seriously damage the family's reputation. The passage describes a meeting between Sherlock Holmes and a man who later reveals himself to be the King of Bohemia. The King explains that he is seeking Holmes's help in a delicate matter concerning a woman named Irene Adler. The King of Bohemia has hired Sherlock Holmes to retrieve some compromising letters that he wrote to a young woman. However, the woman refuses to sell them or return them, and several attempts to steal them have failed. The speaker's employer has been threatened by Irene Adler, who has a compromising photograph of the employer. Adler has said she will send the photograph to the employer's fianc\u00e9e's family unless the employer breaks off the engagement. The speaker is sure that Adler has not sent the photograph yet, because she said she would do so on the day the engagement is publicly announced (next Monday). Holmes is hired by a king to find a missing photograph. He is given a large sum of money and the address of the person who has it. He plans to meet with Watson the next day to discuss the case. The speaker describes how Sherlock Holmes was able to transform himself from a drunken-looking groom into a respectable tweed-suited man. He notes that this was just one of Holmes's many amazing abilities with disguises. The speaker then recounts how Holmes spent his morning and what he did at the end of it. The narrator, in the guise of a groom out of work, observed the habits and home of Miss Irene Adler. He learned from the local stable hands that she had turned the heads of all the local men. A woman who lives quietly and sings at concerts is the subject of gossip among cab drivers. They know that she has a male visitor who is a lawyer, and they speculate about the nature of their relationship. The narrator is trying to decide whether to investigate the woman or the man. A hansom cab pulls up to Briony Lodge and a gentleman emerges. He is in a hurry and appears to be the man of whom the narrator has heard. He goes into the house and the narrator sees him through the window, pacing and talking excitedly. He comes out and gets into the cab, telling the driver to hurry. The driver of a landau pulls up and a woman gets in, telling him to hurry to the Church of St. Monica. A man is being chased by two people, one of whom is Irene Adler. He escapes by getting into a cab and telling the driver to take him to the Church of St. Monica. He arrives just in time to see Adler and the other person getting married. The passage describes a man's encounter with a couple who were about to be married. The man ended up being their witness, and the bride gave him a sovereign. The man then says that he needs to make his own arrangements, which are cold beef and a glass of beer. The speaker is telling the person they are speaking to that they must not interfere in what is about to happen, and that they will know what to do when the time comes. Holmes and Watson are planning to use a fire as a distraction to break into a house. Holmes will pose as a clergyman, and Watson will wait for his signal to throw an object through the window and raise the alarm. The passage describes the scene around a house, and Holmes observes that the recent marriage of the occupants makes the search for a photograph more complicated. He reasons that the woman most likely has the photograph in her own possession, rather than with her banker or lawyer. A lady steps out of her carriage and is immediately surrounded by a group of men who start fighting with each other. One of the men is Holmes, who is trying to protect the lady. He gets hit and falls to the ground. Irene Adler helps an injured man, even though she is being watched by Sherlock Holmes, who is trying to blackmail her. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson set off a smoke bomb in order to distract a crowd and allow them to escape. A man is pretending to be injured and is carried into a woman's home. He knows she will try to save her most precious belongings in a fire, so he starts a fire and she grabs the photograph he is looking for. Someone has stolen a photograph from a house, and Sherlock Holmes is on the case. He and a companion will call on the house tomorrow morning to try to find the thief and retrieve the photograph. Irene Adler is married, and Sherlock Holmes is in hopes that she loves her husband, because it would spare the King of Bohemia all fear of future annoyance. The woman in the passage has left England, and the person she was speaking to (Sherlock Holmes) is surprised and disappointed. He had been hoping to get some information from her. Irene Adler is an actress who has masqueraded as a man before. She followed Sherlock Holmes to his home and then ran off to her husband. They are leaving because the king wronged them and they have a photograph to prove it. In the passage, Holmes is discussing with the King how a woman's wit has bested his plans. He seems to be impressed by the woman, and the King offers to reward him. Holmes requests the woman's photograph, and the King agrees.

The passage describes a man's reaction to an advertisement seeking red-headed men for a job that pays 4 pounds a week. The man is incredulous and wonders what the job could entail. Holmes finds the whole situation amusing and encourages the man to tell his story.\n\nLast chunk: \u201cWell, I never!\u201d said he. \u201cI thought at first that you had done something clever, but I see that there was nothing in it after all.\u201d  \u201cI begin to think, Watson,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cthat I make a mistake in explaining. \u2018_Omne ignotum pro magnifico_,\u2019 you know, and my poor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am so candid.

He respected her for her intelligence and ability to read people, but their relationship was never romantic. Sherlock Holmes is still living in Baker Street and is still interested in crime. Watson sees him one night and they catch up. Sherlock Holmes deduces that Watson has gained weight and gone into practice again, based on his appearance. The passage describes how Sherlock Holmes deduces various things about a person based on their appearance. He explains that it is simple to do once you know how, but that most people are baffled by the process. A man receives a note asking him to meet a masked visitor at 8:15 to discuss a matter of great importance. The man has no idea what the meeting could be about. The passage discusses a note written on paper that is strong and stiff, with a peculiar texture. The paper is from Bohemia, and the note was written by someone who is likely well-to-do. A man enters who is very tall with a muscular build. He is richly dressed. A man wearing a mask enters and Holmes deduces that he is from Bohemia. The man introduces himself as the Count Von Kramm. A man who wishes to remain anonymous visits Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, asking them to swear to secrecy for two years and promising that at the end of that time, the matter will be of no importance. The man explains that the matter involves the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia, and that it has the potential to grow into a scandal that could seriously damage the family's reputation. The passage describes a meeting between Sherlock Holmes and a man who later reveals himself to be the King of Bohemia. The King explains that he is seeking Holmes's help in a delicate matter concerning a woman named Irene Adler. The King of Bohemia has hired Sherlock Holmes to retrieve some compromising letters that he wrote to a young woman. However, the woman refuses to sell them or return them, and several attempts to steal them have failed. The speaker's employer has been threatened by Irene Adler, who has a compromising photograph of the employer. Adler has said she will send the photograph to the employer's fianc\u00e9e's family unless the employer breaks off the engagement. The speaker is sure that Adler has not sent the photograph yet, because she said she would do so on the day the engagement is publicly announced (next Monday). Holmes is hired by a king to find a missing photograph. He is given a large sum of money and the address of the person who has it. He plans to meet with Watson the next day to discuss the case. The speaker describes how Sherlock Holmes was able to transform himself from a drunken-looking groom into a respectable tweed-suited man. He notes that this was just one of Holmes's many amazing abilities with disguises. The speaker then recounts how Holmes spent his morning and what he did at the end of it. The narrator, in the guise of a groom out of work, observed the habits and home of Miss Irene Adler. He learned from the local stable hands that she had turned the heads of all the local men. A woman who lives quietly and sings at concerts is the subject of gossip among cab drivers. They know that she has a male visitor who is a lawyer, and they speculate about the nature of their relationship. The narrator is trying to decide whether to investigate the woman or the man. A hansom cab pulls up to Briony Lodge and a gentleman emerges. He is in a hurry and appears to be the man of whom the narrator has heard. He goes into the house and the narrator sees him through the window, pacing and talking excitedly. He comes out and gets into the cab, telling the driver to hurry. The driver of a landau pulls up and a woman gets in, telling him to hurry to the Church of St. Monica. A man is being chased by two people, one of whom is Irene Adler. He escapes by getting into a cab and telling the driver to take him to the Church of St. Monica. He arrives just in time to see Adler and the other person getting married. The passage describes a man's encounter with a couple who were about to be married. The man ended up being their witness, and the bride gave him a sovereign. The man then says that he needs to make his own arrangements, which are cold beef and a glass of beer. The speaker is telling the person they are speaking to that they must not interfere in what is about to happen, and that they will know what to do when the time comes. Holmes and Watson are planning to use a fire as a distraction to break into a house. Holmes will pose as a clergyman, and Watson will wait for his signal to throw an object through the window and raise the alarm. The passage describes the scene around a house, and Holmes observes that the recent marriage of the occupants makes the search for a photograph more complicated. He reasons that the woman most likely has the photograph in her own possession, rather than with her banker or lawyer. A lady steps out of her carriage and is immediately surrounded by a group of men who start fighting with each other. One of the men is Holmes, who is trying to protect the lady. He gets hit and falls to the ground. Irene Adler helps an injured man, even though she is being watched by Sherlock Holmes, who is trying to blackmail her. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson set off a smoke bomb in order to distract a crowd and allow them to escape. A man is pretending to be injured and is carried into a woman's home. He knows she will try to save her most precious belongings in a fire, so he starts a fire and she grabs the photograph he is looking for. Someone has stolen a photograph from a house, and Sherlock Holmes is on the case. He and a companion will call on the house tomorrow morning to try to find the thief and retrieve the photograph. Irene Adler is married, and Sherlock Holmes is in hopes that she loves her husband, because it would spare the King of Bohemia all fear of future annoyance. The woman in the passage has left England, and the person she was speaking to (Sherlock Holmes) is surprised and disappointed. He had been hoping to get some information from her. Irene Adler is an actress who has masqueraded as a man before. She followed Sherlock Holmes to his home and then ran off to her husband. They are leaving because the king wronged them and they have a photograph to prove it. In the passage, Holmes is discussing with the King how a woman's wit has bested his plans. He seems to be impressed by the woman, and the King offers to reward him. Holmes requests the woman's photograph, and the King agrees. In the autumn of last year, Sherlock Holmes was in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair. I was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me. The stout gentleman was Mr. Wilson, Holmes' partner and helper in many of his most successful cases. A man comes to Sherlock Holmes to tell him about a very strange series of events. It is not clear if a crime has been committed, but the story is very curious. The passage describes a man who is seeking Sherlock Holmes' help. The man is average-looking, except for his red hair and disgruntled expression. Holmes deduces from the man's appearance that he has done manual labor at some point. The speaker uses Mr. Jabez Wilson's physical appearance to deduce that he is a manual laborer, a Freemason, and has recently been to China. The passage describes a man's reaction to an advertisement seeking red-headed men for a job that pays 4 pounds a week. The man is incredulous and wonders what the job could entail. Holmes finds the whole situation amusing and encourages the man to tell his story. This passage describes a man's assistant, who is very good at his job but likes to take pictures in his spare time. The man says that he is willing to work for less than he is worth because he enjoys learning the business. The passage describes a man who is considering joining the League of the Red-headed Men. He is told that the vacancy is worth quite a fortune, and that there are more vacancies than there are men. He is also told that the trustees are at their wits end what to do with the money.\n\nLast chunk: fault, but on the whole he\u2019s a good worker. There\u2019s no vice in him.\u201d  \u201cHe is still with you, I presume?\u201d  \u201cYes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the place clean\u2014that\u2019s all I have in the house, for I am a widower and never had any family. We live very quietly, sir, the three of us; and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts, if we do nothing more.  \u201cThe first thing that put us out was that advertisement. Spaulding, he came down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very paper in his hand, and he says:  \u201c\u2018I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.\u2019  \u201c\u2018Why that?\u2019 I asks.  \u201c\u2018Why,\u2019 says he, \u2018here\u2019s another vacancy on the League of the Red-headed Men. It\u2019s worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than there are men, so that the trustees are at their wits\u2019 end what to do with the money. If my hair would only change colour, here\u2019s a nice little crib all ready for me to step into.\u2019  \u201c\u2018Why, what is it, then?\u2019 I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a very stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the door-mat. In that way I didn\u2019t know much of what was going on outside, and I was always glad of a bit of news.  \u201c\u2018Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?\u2019 he asked with his eyes open.  \u201c\u2018Never.\u2019  \u201c\u2018Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible\n\nNext chunk:", "completion": " yourself for one of the vacancies.\u2019  \u201c\u2018And what are they worth?\u2019 I asked.  \u201c\u2018Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it need not interfere very much with one\u2019s other occupations.\u2019  \u201cWell, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the business has not been over good for some years, and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy.  \u201c\u2018Tell me all about it,\u2019 said I.  \u201c\u2018Well,\u2019 said he, showing me the advertisement, \u2018you can see for yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address where you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out, the League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men; so, when he died, it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour. From all I hear it is splendid pay and very little to do.\u2019  \u201c\u2018But,\u2019 said I, \u2018there would be millions of red-headed men who would apply.\u2019  \u201c\u2018Not so many as you might think,\u2019 he answered. \u2018You see it is really confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had started from London when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn. Then, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery red."}

A man who wishes to remain anonymous visits Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, asking them to swear to secrecy for two years and promising that at the end of that time, the matter will be of no importance. The man explains that the matter involves the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia, and that it has the potential to grow into a scandal that could seriously damage the family's reputation. The passage describes a meeting between Sherlock Holmes and a man who later reveals himself to be the King of Bohemia. The King explains that he is seeking Holmes's help in a delicate matter concerning a woman named Irene Adler. The King of Bohemia has hired Sherlock Holmes to retrieve some compromising letters that he wrote to a young woman. However, the woman refuses to sell them or return them, and several attempts to steal them have failed. The speaker's employer has been threatened by Irene Adler, who has a compromising photograph of the employer. Adler has said she will send the photograph to the employer's fianc\u00e9e's family unless the employer breaks off the engagement. The speaker is sure that Adler has not sent the photograph yet, because she said she would do so on the day the engagement is publicly announced (next Monday). Holmes is hired by a king to find a missing photograph. He is given a large sum of money and the address of the person who has it. He plans to meet with Watson the next day to discuss the case. The speaker describes how Sherlock Holmes was able to transform himself from a drunken-looking groom into a respectable tweed-suited man. He notes that this was just one of Holmes's many amazing abilities with disguises. The speaker then recounts how Holmes spent his morning and what he did at the end of it. The narrator, in the guise of a groom out of work, observed the habits and home of Miss Irene Adler. He learned from the local stable hands that she had turned the heads of all the local men. A woman who lives quietly and sings at concerts is the subject of gossip among cab drivers. They know that she has a male visitor who is a lawyer, and they speculate about the nature of their relationship. The narrator is trying to decide whether to investigate the woman or the man. A hansom cab pulls up to Briony Lodge and a gentleman emerges. He is in a hurry and appears to be the man of whom the narrator has heard. He goes into the house and the narrator sees him through the window, pacing and talking excitedly. He comes out and gets into the cab, telling the driver to hurry. The driver of a landau pulls up and a woman gets in, telling him to hurry to the Church of St. Monica. A man is being chased by two people, one of whom is Irene Adler. He escapes by getting into a cab and telling the driver to take him to the Church of St. Monica. He arrives just in time to see Adler and the other person getting married. The passage describes a man's encounter with a couple who were about to be married. The man ended up being their witness, and the bride gave him a sovereign. The man then says that he needs to make his own arrangements, which are cold beef and a glass of beer. The speaker is telling the person they are speaking to that they must not interfere in what is about to happen, and that they will know what to do when the time comes. Holmes and Watson are planning to use a fire as a distraction to break into a house. Holmes will pose as a clergyman, and Watson will wait for his signal to throw an object through the window and raise the alarm. The passage describes the scene around a house, and Holmes observes that the recent marriage of the occupants makes the search for a photograph more complicated. He reasons that the woman most likely has the photograph in her own possession, rather than with her banker or lawyer. A lady steps out of her carriage and is immediately surrounded by a group of men who start fighting with each other. One of the men is Holmes, who is trying to protect the lady. He gets hit and falls to the ground. Irene Adler helps an injured man, even though she is being watched by Sherlock Holmes, who is trying to blackmail her. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson set off a smoke bomb in order to distract a crowd and allow them to escape. A man is pretending to be injured and is carried into a woman's home. He knows she will try to save her most precious belongings in a fire, so he starts a fire and she grabs the photograph he is looking for. Someone has stolen a photograph from a house, and Sherlock Holmes is on the case. He and a companion will call on the house tomorrow morning to try to find the thief and retrieve the photograph. Irene Adler is married, and Sherlock Holmes is in hopes that she loves her husband, because it would spare the King of Bohemia all fear of future annoyance. The woman in the passage has left England, and the person she was speaking to (Sherlock Holmes) is surprised and disappointed. He had been hoping to get some information from her. Irene Adler is an actress who has masqueraded as a man before. She followed Sherlock Holmes to his home and then ran off to her husband. They are leaving because the king wronged them and they have a photograph to prove it. In the passage, Holmes is discussing with the King how a woman's wit has bested his plans. He seems to be impressed by the woman, and the King offers to reward him. Holmes requests the woman's photograph, and the King agrees. In the autumn of last year, Sherlock Holmes was in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair. I was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me. The stout gentleman was Mr. Wilson, Holmes' partner and helper in many of his most successful cases. A man comes to Sherlock Holmes to tell him about a very strange series of events. It is not clear if a crime has been committed, but the story is very curious. The passage describes a man who is seeking Sherlock Holmes' help. The man is average-looking, except for his red hair and disgruntled expression. Holmes deduces from the man's appearance that he has done manual labor at some point. The speaker uses Mr. Jabez Wilson's physical appearance to deduce that he is a manual laborer, a Freemason, and has recently been to China. The passage describes a man's reaction to an advertisement seeking red-headed men for a job that pays 4 pounds a week. The man is incredulous and wonders what the job could entail. Holmes finds the whole situation amusing and encourages the man to tell his story. This passage describes a man's assistant, who is very good at his job but likes to take pictures in his spare time. The man says that he is willing to work for less than he is worth because he enjoys learning the business. The passage describes a man who is considering joining the League of the Red-headed Men. He is told that the vacancy is worth quite a fortune, and that there are more vacancies than there are men. He is also told that the trustees are at their wits end what to do with the money. A man tells his friend about a vacancy at the League, a organization that provides easy berths to red-headed men living in London. The pay is good and there is very little work required. This passage describes a man's experience answering an advertisement for a red-headed man. He is amazed at the number of redheads who show up for the job, and his companion Spaulding encourages him to continue despite the competition.\n\nLast chunk: Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.\u2019  \u201cNow, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter I stood as good a chance as any man that I had ever met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me. He was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement.  \u201cI never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement. Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope\u2019s Court looked like a coster\u2019s orange barrow. I should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement. Every shade of colour they were\u2014straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were not many who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how many were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding would not hear of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and\n\nNext chunk:", "completion": " pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up to the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream upon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office.\u201d  \u201cYour experience has been a most entertaining one,\u201d remarked Holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff. \u201cPray continue your very interesting statement.\u201d  \u201cThere was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate as he came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter, after all. However, when our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.  \u201c\u2018This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,\u2019 said my assistant, \u2018and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the League.\u2019  \u201c\u2018And he is admirably suited for it,\u2019 the other answered. \u2018He has every requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so fine.\u2019 He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.  \u201c\u2018It would be injustice to hesitate,\u2019 said"}
