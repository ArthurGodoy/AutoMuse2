In the autumn of last year, Sherlock Holmes was in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair. I was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me. The stout gentleman was Mr. Wilson, Holmes' partner and helper in many of his most successful cases.
