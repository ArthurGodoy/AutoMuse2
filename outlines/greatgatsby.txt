Nick Carraway, a Yale graduate and veteran of the Great War, moves to New York to become a bond salesman. Nick rents a small house in the West Egg district of Long Island, next door to the mansion of Jay Gatsby, a millionaire who throws extravagant parties. Nick is drawn into the lifestyle of his neighbor, and he attends one of Gatsby's parties. There, he meets Jordan Baker, a beautiful young woman with whom he begins a brief affair. Nick also re-encounters his second cousin, Daisy Buchanan, who is now married to the wealthy but brutish Tom Buchanan. Daisy introduces Nick to her husband, who immediately takes a dislike to the young man. One night, Nick brings Jordan to Gatsby's house for tea, and they are astonished to discover that Daisy and Tom are also there. Daisy is taken with Gatsby and his wealth, and she begins an affair with him behind her husband's back. As the summer progresses, Nick witnesses the devastating effects of Daisy's selfishness on both Gatsby and Tom. When Tom becomes suspicious of Daisy's relationship with Gatsby, he arranges for Gatsby to be caught with another woman. Daisy flees back to East Egg with Tom, leaving Gatsby heartbroken. Nick confronts Tom about his treatment of Gatsby, and the two men part ways. Months later, Nick learns that Gatsby has been shot to death by George Wilson, husband of the woman with whom Gatsby was caught. Nick visits Gatsby's empty mansion and comes to realize that the life Gatsby led was built on lies and deception. Nick attends Gatsby's funeral, where he is the only guest, and he reflects on the futility of the human condition.
