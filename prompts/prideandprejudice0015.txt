Story so far:  This is a Project Gutenberg eBook of Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. It is available for free online and can be reused under the Project Gutenberg License. Mr. and Mrs. Bennet discuss the news that Netherfield Park has been let to a wealthy young man from up north. The passage describes Mr. Bennet's reaction to his wife's suggestion that they visit Mr. Bingley, a wealthy single man who is moving into the neighborhood. Mr. Bennet is not interested in meeting Mr. Bingley, but his wife insists that they do so. Mr. Bennet is over scrupulous and is preventing Mr. Bingley from marrying one of his daughters. He is concerned that they are all silly and ignorant, but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters. Mr. Bennet is an odd mixture of quick wit, sarcasm, and caprice, something his wife has not been able to understand fully after 23 years. Mrs. Bennet is a woman of low intelligence and bad temper. Their main goal in life is to get their daughters married off. When Mr. Bennet unexpectedly announces he is going to visit Mr. Bingley, Elizabeth is the only one who knows why. The passage discusses Mr. Bingley and whether or not he will be introduced to Mrs. Long. It is concluded that Mrs. Bennet will not do the introducing because she does not know him well enough herself. The girls' father will take it upon himself to decline Mr. Bingley's acquaintance after Mrs. Bennet declares she is sick of him. The passage describes Mr. Bennet's reaction to his wife's news that their girls had met a new young man. He is pleased and amused, and predicts that the man will soon be asking one of them to dance. His wife and daughters then try to get more information about him from Mr. Bennet, but he is evasive. Lady Lucas reports that Bingley is young, handsome, and agreeable, and that he plans to attend the next assembly with a large party. Mrs. Bennet is pleased at the prospect of one of her daughters marrying Bingley, and an invitation to dinner is dispatched. However, Bingley must go to town the following day and is unable to accept. Mr. Bingley arrives in Hertfordshire and is quickly followed by rumors that he is bringing a large party of twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the ball. Upon his arrival, it is revealed that he has only brought six people with him. Mr. Bingley is a good-looking man with easy manners, while his sisters are fashionable women. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, looks like a gentleman, and his friend Mr. Darcy is a tall and handsome man who quickly catches the attention of the room. Mr. Darcy is a wealthy man who is considered to be very handsome, but he is also very proud and arrogant. He spends most of the evening at a ball walking around the room, and people hope he will not return. Mrs. Bennet is one of the people who strongly dislikes him. The passage describes Mr. Darcy's conversation with Mr. Bingley about the Bennet sisters. Mr. Darcy is not interested in dancing with any of the Bennet sisters, but Mr. Bingley finds them all very pleasant and pretty. Mr. Darcy is rude to Elizabeth and she is not pleased. Mr. Bennet is up late, reading, when his wife comes home from a ball. She reports that Jane was much admired and danced twice with Mr. Bingley. Mr. Bennet is pleased to hear this. Mrs. Bennet is delighted with Mr. Bingley, who she thinks is very handsome, and his sisters, who she thinks are charming women. However, she cannot stand Mr. Darcy, who she thinks is a very disagreeable, conceited man. Jane agrees with her mother about Mr. Bingley, and expresses admiration for him.

Last chunk: “he would not have danced half so much! For God’s       sake, say no more of his partners. Oh that he had sprained his       ankle in the first dance!”        “Oh! my dear,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively       handsome! and his sisters are charming women. I never in my life       saw anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace       upon Mrs. Hurst’s gown—”        Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any       description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another       branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of       spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.        “But I can assure you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much       by not suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid       man, not at all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that       there was no enduring him! He walked here, and he walked there,       fancying himself so very great! Not handsome enough to dance       with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one       of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.”     Chapter 4        When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been       cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her       sister how very much she admired him.        “He is just what a young man ought to be,” said she, “sensible,       good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy
