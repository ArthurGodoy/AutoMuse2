Story so far:  This is a Project Gutenberg eBook of Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. It is available for free online and can be reused under the Project Gutenberg License. Mr. and Mrs. Bennet discuss the news that Netherfield Park has been let to a wealthy young man from up north. The passage describes Mr. Bennet's reaction to his wife's suggestion that they visit Mr. Bingley, a wealthy single man who is moving into the neighborhood. Mr. Bennet is not interested in meeting Mr. Bingley, but his wife insists that they do so. Mr. Bennet is over scrupulous and is preventing Mr. Bingley from marrying one of his daughters. He is concerned that they are all silly and ignorant, but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters. Mr. Bennet is an odd mixture of quick wit, sarcasm, and caprice, something his wife has not been able to understand fully after 23 years. Mrs. Bennet is a woman of low intelligence and bad temper. Their main goal in life is to get their daughters married off. When Mr. Bennet unexpectedly announces he is going to visit Mr. Bingley, Elizabeth is the only one who knows why.

She was a       woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain       temper. When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous.       The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its       solace was visiting and news.     Chapter 2        Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr.       Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last       always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the       evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it. It       was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his second       daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her       with,        “I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.”        “We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,” said her       mother resentfully, “since we are not to visit.”        “But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth,
