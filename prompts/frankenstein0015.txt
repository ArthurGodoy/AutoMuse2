The passage describes the author's excitement at the prospect of exploring the Arctic, which he imagines as a land of beauty and wonder. The author is discussing their motivations for embarking on a voyage to the North Pole, and how they hope to make various discoveries that will benefit all of humanity. They conclude by expressing their excitement for the journey ahead. The speaker recalls how, as a child, they were fascinated by their uncle's library of books on voyages of discovery. Despite their education being neglected, they read these books avidly and dreamed of going on such voyages themselves. These dreams faded when they discovered poetry and realized that they could have their own niche in the world of literature. However, when they inherited their cousin's fortune, they decided to pursue their earlier dream of going on a great voyage of discovery. For this, they trained their body to endure hardship and studied various sciences. The narrator is an adventurer who has decided to embark on a long and difficult journey. They are aware of the dangers involved, but feel that the rewards are worth the risks. They are confident in their abilities, but sometimes find it difficult to maintain their spirits. The passage describes the narrator's plans to sail to the Arctic in search of a new land. He laments not having a friend to share in his adventure, but is determined to go forward with his plans. The passage describes the author's feelings of loneliness and isolation, and his desire for a friend who can understand and sympathize with him. He laments his lack of education and formal training, and wishes for someone who can help him to control and focus his thoughts. This passage describes the author's lieutenant and master, both of whom are men of great character. The author first met the lieutenant on a whale vessel and was impressed by his courage and desire for glory. The author then met the master and was impressed by his kindness, courage, and respect from his crew. A man loved a young Russian woman but she was in love with someone else. He gave her to her lover and left the country. The speaker is looking forward to their upcoming voyage to unexplored regions, and is preparing to depart. They are excited and nervous about what they will find, and hope to kill no albatrosses. The speaker attributes their love of the ocean to the work of a poet. The author is on a voyage to explore unvisited regions and is writing to his sister to update her on his progress. He is in good spirits and his men are not deterred by the dangers they may encounter. He is looking forward to reaching his destination. The author describes an accident at sea and says that he hopes nothing worse will happen on the voyage. He expresses confidence that he will be successful in his endeavors. A group of sailors on a ship in the Arctic Ocean spot a man in a sledge being pulled by dogs. They watch him for a while, but he eventually disappears into the distance. Later, they hear the sound of the ice breaking and realize that their ship is now free. However, they remain cautious and stay put for the night. In the morning, they see that there is indeed a sledge and a man in the water next to their ship. A man is rescued from an ice floe by a passing ship. He is European, not a savage, and is surprised to learn that the ship is bound for the northern pole. He is in a terrible state, but is revived and brought into the ship. A man is found near death on the ice, and is revived by brandy and soup. He is taken to the speaker's cabin to recover, and the speaker notes that he is generally melancholy and sometimes seems mad. The lieutenant asks him why he came so far on the ice, and he replies that he is seeking someone who fled from him.

Last chunk: rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to swallow a small quantity. As soon as he showed signs of life we wrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the kitchen stove. By slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup, which restored him wonderfully.  Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak, and I often feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding. When he had in some measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin and attended on him as much as my duty would permit. I never saw a more interesting creature: his eyes have generally an expression of wildness, and even madness, but there are moments when, if anyone performs an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most trifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with a beam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled. But he is generally melancholy and despairing, and sometimes he gnashes his teeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him.  When my guest was a little recovered I had great trouble to keep off the men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose. Once, however, the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice in so strange a vehicle.  His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, and he replied, â€œTo seek one who fled from
