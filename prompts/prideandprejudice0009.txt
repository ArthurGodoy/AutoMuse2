Story so far:  This is a Project Gutenberg eBook of Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. It is available for free online and can be reused under the Project Gutenberg License. Mr. and Mrs. Bennet discuss the news that Netherfield Park has been let to a wealthy young man from up north. The passage describes Mr. Bennet's reaction to his wife's suggestion that they visit Mr. Bingley, a wealthy single man who is moving into the neighborhood. Mr. Bennet is not interested in meeting Mr. Bingley, but his wife insists that they do so. Mr. Bennet is over scrupulous and is preventing Mr. Bingley from marrying one of his daughters. He is concerned that they are all silly and ignorant, but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters. Mr. Bennet is an odd mixture of quick wit, sarcasm, and caprice, something his wife has not been able to understand fully after 23 years. Mrs. Bennet is a woman of low intelligence and bad temper. Their main goal in life is to get their daughters married off. When Mr. Bennet unexpectedly announces he is going to visit Mr. Bingley, Elizabeth is the only one who knows why. The passage discusses Mr. Bingley and whether or not he will be introduced to Mrs. Long. It is concluded that Mrs. Bennet will not do the introducing because she does not know him well enough herself. The girls' father will take it upon himself to decline Mr. Bingley's acquaintance after Mrs. Bennet declares she is sick of him. The passage describes Mr. Bennet's reaction to his wife's news that their girls had met a new young man. He is pleased and amused, and predicts that the man will soon be asking one of them to dance. His wife and daughters then try to get more information about him from Mr. Bennet, but he is evasive. Lady Lucas reports that Bingley is young, handsome, and agreeable, and that he plans to attend the next assembly with a large party. Mrs. Bennet is pleased at the prospect of one of her daughters marrying Bingley, and an invitation to dinner is dispatched. However, Bingley must go to town the following day and is unable to accept.

Last chunk: them all; and they were at last obliged to accept the       second-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady Lucas. Her       report was highly favourable. Sir William had been delighted with       him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely       agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next       assembly with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To       be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love;       and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley’s heart were entertained.        “If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at       Netherfield,” said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, “and all the       others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for.”        In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet’s visit, and sat       about ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained       hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose       beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies       were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of       ascertaining from an upper window, that he wore a blue coat and       rode a black horse.        An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and       already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do       credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred       it all. Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day,       and consequently unable to accept the
