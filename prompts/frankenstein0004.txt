The passage describes the author's excitement at the prospect of exploring the Arctic, which he imagines as a land of beauty and wonder. The author is discussing their motivations for embarking on a voyage to the North Pole, and how they hope to make various discoveries that will benefit all of humanity. They conclude by expressing their excitement for the journey ahead. The speaker recalls how, as a child, they were fascinated by their uncle's library of books on voyages of discovery.
