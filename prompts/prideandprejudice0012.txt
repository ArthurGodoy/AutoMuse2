Mr. and Mrs. Bennet discuss the news that Netherfield Park has been let to a wealthy young man from up north. The passage describes Mr. Bennet's reaction to his wife's suggestion that they visit Mr. Bingley, a wealthy single man who is moving into the neighborhood. Mr. Bennet is not interested in meeting Mr. Bingley, but his wife insists that they do so. Mr. Bennet is over scrupulous and is preventing Mr. Bingley from marrying one of his daughters. He is concerned that they are all silly and ignorant, but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters. Mr. Bennet is an odd mixture of quick wit, sarcasm, and caprice, something his wife has not been able to understand fully after 23 years. Mrs. Bennet is a woman of low intelligence and bad temper. Their main goal in life is to get their daughters married off. When Mr. Bennet unexpectedly announces he is going to visit Mr. Bingley, Elizabeth is the only one who knows why. The passage discusses Mr. Bingley and whether or not he will be introduced to Mrs. Long. It is concluded that Mrs. Bennet will not do the introducing because she does not know him well enough herself. The girls' father will take it upon himself to decline Mr. Bingley's acquaintance after Mrs. Bennet declares she is sick of him. The passage describes Mr. Bennet's reaction to his wife's news that their girls had met a new young man. He is pleased and amused, and predicts that the man will soon be asking one of them to dance. His wife and daughters then try to get more information about him from Mr. Bennet, but he is evasive. Lady Lucas reports that Bingley is young, handsome, and agreeable, and that he plans to attend the next assembly with a large party. Mrs. Bennet is pleased at the prospect of one of her daughters marrying Bingley, and an invitation to dinner is dispatched. However, Bingley must go to town the following day and is unable to accept. Mr. Bingley arrives in Hertfordshire and is quickly followed by rumors that he is bringing a large party of twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the ball. Upon his arrival, it is revealed that he has only brought six people with him. Mr. Bingley is a good-looking man with easy manners, while his sisters are fashionable women. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, looks like a gentleman, and his friend Mr. Darcy is a tall and handsome man who quickly catches the attention of the room. Mr. Darcy is a wealthy man who is considered to be very handsome, but he is also very proud and arrogant. He spends most of the evening at a ball walking around the room, and people hope he will not return. Mrs. Bennet is one of the people who strongly dislikes him. The passage describes Mr. Darcy's conversation with Mr. Bingley about the Bennet sisters. Mr. Darcy is not interested in dancing with any of the Bennet sisters, but Mr. Bingley finds them all very pleasant and pretty.

Last chunk: resentment by his having slighted one of her       daughters.        Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen,       to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr.       Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a       conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance       for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.        “Come, Darcy,” said he, “I must have you dance. I hate to see you       standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much       better dance.”        “I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am       particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as       this, it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and       there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a       punishment to me to stand up with.”        “I would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried Bingley,       “for a kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant       girls in my life as I have this evening; and there are several of       them you see uncommonly pretty.”        “_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said       Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.        “Oh! she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there       is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very       pretty, and I dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner       to introduce you.”        “Which
