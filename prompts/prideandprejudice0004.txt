Mr. and Mrs. Bennet discuss the news that Netherfield Park has been let to a wealthy young man from up north. The passage describes Mr. Bennet's reaction to his wife's suggestion that they visit Mr. Bingley, a wealthy single man who is moving into the neighborhood. Mr. Bennet is not interested in meeting Mr. Bingley, but his wife insists that they do so. Mr. Bennet is over scrupulous and is preventing Mr. Bingley from marrying one of his daughters. He is concerned that they are all silly and ignorant, but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters.

Sir William and Lady Lucas are       determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you       know, they visit no newcomers.

You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor       nerves.”        “You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves.       They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with       consideration these twenty years at least.”        “Ah, you do not know what I suffer.”        “But
