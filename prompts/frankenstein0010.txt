Despite their education being neglected, they read these books avidly and dreamed of going on such voyages themselves. These dreams faded when they discovered poetry and realized that they could have their own niche in the world of literature.

Those are as fixed as fate, and my voyage is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation. The winter has been dreadfully severe, but the spring promises well, and it is considered as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps I may sail sooner than I expected. I shall do nothing rashly: you know me sufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the safety of others is committed to my care.
