Story so far:  This passage is from the Project Gutenberg eBook of The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The eBook is available for free to anyone in the United States and most other parts of the world, with few restrictions. The Great Gatsby is a novel about a man who is trying to win back the love of his life. The author reflects on some advice they received to not be so quick to judge others, and how this has led to them learning more about people. However, they admit that there are still some people they just can't see eye to eye with. The narrator reflects on how, after returning from the East last autumn, he wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever. He exempts Gatsby from this feeling, because Gatsby represents everything the narrator has an unaffected scorn for. The narrator describes Gatsby as having an extraordinary gift for hope and a romantic readiness that he has never found in any other person. At the end of the passage, the narrator reflects on how Gatsby turned out all right in the end, despite the challenges he faced. The passage describes the author's background and how he came to move to the East Coast. He reflects on how different the East Coast felt from the Midwest and how he enjoyed his time there. The narrator moves to the country alone, but soon meets a man who makes him feel less lonely. He buys books on finance and plans to read them over the summer. The passage describes the author's experience living in one of the "strangest communities in North America" - two large eggs shaped islands off the coast of Long Island. The author lived on the less fashionable of the two islands, West Egg. The passage describes Gatsby's mansion and the Buchanans' house across the water. The narrator reflects on how he used to know Tom in college and how Tom and Daisy have become much wealthier since then. The narrator wonders why they came East. The passage describes a wealthy man named Tom Buchanan, who has changed since the narrator last saw him. He is now arrogant and has a commanding presence. The narrator is visiting his home, which is an elaborate mansion. Tom is standing on the porch, and the narrator can see that he is a very powerful man. The passage describes a man who is physically strong and imposing, with a gruff voice that conveys a touch of contempt. The man is talking to the narrator on a porch, pointing out the features of his home. He is polite but abrupt, and the narrator gets the impression that he is not entirely comfortable in his own skin. The passage describes a room with blowing curtains and two young women who appear to be floating on a couch. The younger woman is completely still, and the other girl laughs when she sees the narrator. The narrator is happy and feels paralyzed by the scene.

Last chunk: the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-coloured rug, making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea.  The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon. They were both in white, and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house. I must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall. Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room, and the curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor.  The younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was extended full length at her end of the divan, completely motionless, and with her chin raised a little, as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely to fall. If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of it—indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having disturbed her by coming in.  The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise—she leaned slightly forward with a conscientious expression—then she laughed, an absurd, charming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the room.  “I’m p-paralysed with happiness.”  She laughed again,
