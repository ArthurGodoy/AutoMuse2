Story so far:  Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a novel by Lewis Carroll. It tells the story of Alice, who falls down a rabbit hole into a fantastical world populated by strange creatures. The novel features such classic scenes as the Mad Hatter's tea party and the Queen's croquet game. Alice gets bored sitting by her sister and sees a white rabbit with a pocket watch. She chases it and falls down a rabbit hole. Alice falls down a very deep well, and has plenty of time to look around as she falls. She sees that the well is filled with shelves and cupboards, and takes down a jar of orange marmalade. She wonders how far she has fallen and if she will ever reach the bottom. Alice is falling down a rabbit hole and wonders aloud about the different things she's passing. She wonders if she'll fall all the way through the earth and come out in Australia or New Zealand. Alice gets sleepy and continues to talk to herself. Alice falls asleep and dreams that she is talking to Dinah, her cat. In the dream, she asks Dinah if she has ever eaten a bat. Suddenly, Alice wakes up and finds herself in a long, dark hallway. She sees a small table with a golden key on it and tries to use the key to unlock one of the doors in the hallway, but it doesn't work. Alice is sad and wonders how she will ever get out of the hallway.

Last chunk: a dreamy sort of way, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and sometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you see, as she couldn’t answer either question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, “Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?” when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.  Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, “Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it’s getting!” She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.  There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.  Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s first thought was that it might belong to one of the
