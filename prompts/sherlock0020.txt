Story so far:  The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle is a free eBook that can be used by anyone in the United States with very few restrictions. The eBook is updated regularly and is available in English. Sherlock Holmes was not a man who felt emotion, except for one woman: Irene Adler. He respected her for her intelligence and ability to read people, but their relationship was never romantic. Sherlock Holmes is still living in Baker Street and is still interested in crime. Watson sees him one night and they catch up. Sherlock Holmes deduces that Watson has gained weight and gone into practice again, based on his appearance. The passage describes how Sherlock Holmes deduces various things about a person based on their appearance. He explains that it is simple to do once you know how, but that most people are baffled by the process. A man receives a note asking him to meet a masked visitor at 8:15 to discuss a matter of great importance. The man has no idea what the meeting could be about. The passage discusses a note written on paper that is strong and stiff, with a peculiar texture. The paper is from Bohemia, and the note was written by someone who is likely well-to-do. A man enters who is very tall with a muscular build. He is richly dressed. A man wearing a mask enters and Holmes deduces that he is from Bohemia. The man introduces himself as the Count Von Kramm. A man who wishes to remain anonymous visits Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, asking them to swear to secrecy for two years and promising that at the end of that time, the matter will be of no importance. The man explains that the matter involves the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia, and that it has the potential to grow into a scandal that could seriously damage the family's reputation. The passage describes a meeting between Sherlock Holmes and a man who later reveals himself to be the King of Bohemia. The King explains that he is seeking Holmes's help in a delicate matter concerning a woman named Irene Adler. The King of Bohemia has hired Sherlock Holmes to retrieve some compromising letters that he wrote to a young woman. However, the woman refuses to sell them or return them, and several attempts to steal them have failed. The speaker's employer has been threatened by Irene Adler, who has a compromising photograph of the employer. Adler has said she will send the photograph to the employer's fiancée's family unless the employer breaks off the engagement. The speaker is sure that Adler has not sent the photograph yet, because she said she would do so on the day the engagement is publicly announced (next Monday). Holmes is hired by a king to find a missing photograph. He is given a large sum of money and the address of the person who has it. He plans to meet with Watson the next day to discuss the case. The speaker describes how Sherlock Holmes was able to transform himself from a drunken-looking groom into a respectable tweed-suited man. He notes that this was just one of Holmes's many amazing abilities with disguises. The speaker then recounts how Holmes spent his morning and what he did at the end of it. The narrator, in the guise of a groom out of work, observed the habits and home of Miss Irene Adler. He learned from the local stable hands that she had turned the heads of all the local men. A woman who lives quietly and sings at concerts is the subject of gossip among cab drivers. They know that she has a male visitor who is a lawyer, and they speculate about the nature of their relationship. The narrator is trying to decide whether to investigate the woman or the man. A hansom cab pulls up to Briony Lodge and a gentleman emerges. He is in a hurry and appears to be the man of whom the narrator has heard. He goes into the house and the narrator sees him through the window, pacing and talking excitedly. He comes out and gets into the cab, telling the driver to hurry. The driver of a landau pulls up and a woman gets in, telling him to hurry to the Church of St. Monica. A man is being chased by two people, one of whom is Irene Adler. He escapes by getting into a cab and telling the driver to take him to the Church of St. Monica. He arrives just in time to see Adler and the other person getting married. The passage describes a man's encounter with a couple who were about to be married. The man ended up being their witness, and the bride gave him a sovereign. The man then says that he needs to make his own arrangements, which are cold beef and a glass of beer.

Last chunk: in an instant, and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been some informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion.”  “This is a very unexpected turn of affairs,” said I; “and what then?”  “Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part. At the church door, however, they separated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house. ‘I shall drive out in the park at five as usual,’ she said as she left him. I heard no more. They drove away in different directions, and I went off to make my own arrangements.”  “Which are?”  “Some cold beef and a glass of beer,” he answered, ringing the bell. “I have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier still this evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want your co-operation.”  “I shall be delighted.”  “You don’t mind breaking the law?”  “Not in the least.”  “Nor running
