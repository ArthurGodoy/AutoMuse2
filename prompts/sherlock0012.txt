Story so far:  The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle is a free eBook that can be used by anyone in the United States with very few restrictions. The eBook is updated regularly and is available in English. Sherlock Holmes was not a man who felt emotion, except for one woman: Irene Adler. He respected her for her intelligence and ability to read people, but their relationship was never romantic. Sherlock Holmes is still living in Baker Street and is still interested in crime. Watson sees him one night and they catch up. Sherlock Holmes deduces that Watson has gained weight and gone into practice again, based on his appearance. The passage describes how Sherlock Holmes deduces various things about a person based on their appearance. He explains that it is simple to do once you know how, but that most people are baffled by the process. A man receives a note asking him to meet a masked visitor at 8:15 to discuss a matter of great importance. The man has no idea what the meeting could be about. The passage discusses a note written on paper that is strong and stiff, with a peculiar texture. The paper is from Bohemia, and the note was written by someone who is likely well-to-do. A man enters who is very tall with a muscular build. He is richly dressed. A man wearing a mask enters and Holmes deduces that he is from Bohemia. The man introduces himself as the Count Von Kramm. A man who wishes to remain anonymous visits Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, asking them to swear to secrecy for two years and promising that at the end of that time, the matter will be of no importance. The man explains that the matter involves the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia, and that it has the potential to grow into a scandal that could seriously damage the family's reputation. The passage describes a meeting between Sherlock Holmes and a man who later reveals himself to be the King of Bohemia. The King explains that he is seeking Holmes's help in a delicate matter concerning a woman named Irene Adler. The King of Bohemia has hired Sherlock Holmes to retrieve some compromising letters that he wrote to a young woman. However, the woman refuses to sell them or return them, and several attempts to steal them have failed.

In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.  “Let me see!” said Holmes. “Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858. Contralto—hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw—yes! Retired from operatic stage—ha! Living in London—quite so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting those letters back.”  “Precisely so. But how—”  “Was there a secret marriage?”  “None.”  “No legal papers or certificates?”  “None.”  “Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to prove their authenticity?”  “There is the writing.”  “Pooh, pooh! Forgery.”  “My private note-paper.”  “Stolen.”  “My own seal.”  “Imitated.”  “My photograph.”  “Bought.”  “We were both in the photograph.”  “Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion.”  “I was mad—insane.”  “You have compromised yourself seriously.”  “I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now.”  “It must be recovered.”  “We have tried and failed.”  “Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought.”  “She will not sell.”  “Stolen, then.”  “Five attempts have been made.
