Story so far:  The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle is a free eBook that can be used by anyone in the United States with very few restrictions. The eBook is updated regularly and is available in English. Sherlock Holmes was not a man who felt emotion, except for one woman: Irene Adler. He respected her for her intelligence and ability to read people, but their relationship was never romantic. Sherlock Holmes is still living in Baker Street and is still interested in crime. Watson sees him one night and they catch up. Sherlock Holmes deduces that Watson has gained weight and gone into practice again, based on his appearance. The passage describes how Sherlock Holmes deduces various things about a person based on their appearance. He explains that it is simple to do once you know how, but that most people are baffled by the process.

Last chunk: how you deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there, again, I fail to see how you work it out.”  He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.  “It is simplicity itself,” said he; “my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.”  I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction. “When I hear you give your reasons,” I remarked, “the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours.”  “Quite so,” he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down into
