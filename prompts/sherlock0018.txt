Story so far:  The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle is a free eBook that can be used by anyone in the United States with very few restrictions. The eBook is updated regularly and is available in English. Sherlock Holmes was not a man who felt emotion, except for one woman: Irene Adler. He respected her for her intelligence and ability to read people, but their relationship was never romantic. Sherlock Holmes is still living in Baker Street and is still interested in crime. Watson sees him one night and they catch up. Sherlock Holmes deduces that Watson has gained weight and gone into practice again, based on his appearance. The passage describes how Sherlock Holmes deduces various things about a person based on their appearance. He explains that it is simple to do once you know how, but that most people are baffled by the process. A man receives a note asking him to meet a masked visitor at 8:15 to discuss a matter of great importance. The man has no idea what the meeting could be about. The passage discusses a note written on paper that is strong and stiff, with a peculiar texture. The paper is from Bohemia, and the note was written by someone who is likely well-to-do. A man enters who is very tall with a muscular build. He is richly dressed. A man wearing a mask enters and Holmes deduces that he is from Bohemia. The man introduces himself as the Count Von Kramm. A man who wishes to remain anonymous visits Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, asking them to swear to secrecy for two years and promising that at the end of that time, the matter will be of no importance. The man explains that the matter involves the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia, and that it has the potential to grow into a scandal that could seriously damage the family's reputation. The passage describes a meeting between Sherlock Holmes and a man who later reveals himself to be the King of Bohemia. The King explains that he is seeking Holmes's help in a delicate matter concerning a woman named Irene Adler. The King of Bohemia has hired Sherlock Holmes to retrieve some compromising letters that he wrote to a young woman. However, the woman refuses to sell them or return them, and several attempts to steal them have failed. The speaker's employer has been threatened by Irene Adler, who has a compromising photograph of the employer. Adler has said she will send the photograph to the employer's fiancée's family unless the employer breaks off the engagement. The speaker is sure that Adler has not sent the photograph yet, because she said she would do so on the day the engagement is publicly announced (next Monday). Holmes is hired by a king to find a missing photograph. He is given a large sum of money and the address of the person who has it. He plans to meet with Watson the next day to discuss the case. The speaker describes how Sherlock Holmes was able to transform himself from a drunken-looking groom into a respectable tweed-suited man. He notes that this was just one of Holmes's many amazing abilities with disguises. The speaker then recounts how Holmes spent his morning and what he did at the end of it. The narrator, in the guise of a groom out of work, observed the habits and home of Miss Irene Adler. He learned from the local stable hands that she had turned the heads of all the local men. A woman who lives quietly and sings at concerts is the subject of gossip among cab drivers. They know that she has a male visitor who is a lawyer, and they speculate about the nature of their relationship. The narrator is trying to decide whether to investigate the woman or the man. A hansom cab pulls up to Briony Lodge and a gentleman emerges. He is in a hurry and appears to be the man of whom the narrator has heard. He goes into the house and the narrator sees him through the window, pacing and talking excitedly. He comes out and gets into the cab, telling the driver to hurry. The driver of a landau pulls up and a woman gets in, telling him to hurry to the Church of St. Monica.

Last chunk: balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached—evidently the man of whom I had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home.  “He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing. Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly, ‘Drive like the devil,’ he shouted, ‘first to Gross & Hankey’s in Regent Street, and then to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!’  “Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. It hadn’t pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.  “‘The Church of St. Monica, John,’ she cried, ‘and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.’  “This was quite too
