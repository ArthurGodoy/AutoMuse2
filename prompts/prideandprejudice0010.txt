Mr. and Mrs. Bennet discuss the news that Netherfield Park has been let to a wealthy young man from up north. The passage describes Mr. Bennet's reaction to his wife's suggestion that they visit Mr. Bingley, a wealthy single man who is moving into the neighborhood. Mr. Bennet is not interested in meeting Mr. Bingley, but his wife insists that they do so. Mr. Bennet is over scrupulous and is preventing Mr. Bingley from marrying one of his daughters. He is concerned that they are all silly and ignorant, but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters. Mr. Bennet is an odd mixture of quick wit, sarcasm, and caprice, something his wife has not been able to understand fully after 23 years. Mrs. Bennet is a woman of low intelligence and bad temper. Their main goal in life is to get their daughters married off. When Mr. Bennet unexpectedly announces he is going to visit Mr. Bingley, Elizabeth is the only one who knows why. The passage discusses Mr. Bingley and whether or not he will be introduced to Mrs. Long. It is concluded that Mrs. Bennet will not do the introducing because she does not know him well enough herself. The girls' father will take it upon himself to decline Mr. Bingley's acquaintance after Mrs. Bennet declares she is sick of him. The passage describes Mr. Bennet's reaction to his wife's news that their girls had met a new young man. He is pleased and amused, and predicts that the man will soon be asking one of them to dance. His wife and daughters then try to get more information about him from Mr. Bennet, but he is evasive. Lady Lucas reports that Bingley is young, handsome, and agreeable, and that he plans to attend the next assembly with a large party. Mrs. Bennet is pleased at the prospect of one of her daughters marrying Bingley, and an invitation to dinner is dispatched. However, Bingley must go to town the following day and is unable to accept. Mr. Bingley arrives in Hertfordshire and is quickly followed by rumors that he is bringing a large party of twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the ball. Upon his arrival, it is revealed that he has only brought six people with him. Mr. Bingley is a good-looking man with easy manners, while his sisters are fashionable women. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, looks like a gentleman, and his friend Mr. Darcy is a tall and handsome man who quickly catches the attention of the room.

She could       not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his       arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be       always flying about from one place to another, and never settled       at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a       little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to       get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that       Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with       him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a number of       ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing,       that instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from       London, his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered       the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether; Mr.       Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another       young man.        Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant       countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine       women, with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr.       Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon       drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome       features, noble mien, and the report which was in general       circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his
