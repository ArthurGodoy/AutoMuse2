Story so far:  This passage is from the Project Gutenberg eBook of The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The eBook is available for free to anyone in the United States and most other parts of the world, with few restrictions. The Great Gatsby is a novel about a man who is trying to win back the love of his life. The author reflects on some advice they received to not be so quick to judge others, and how this has led to them learning more about people. However, they admit that there are still some people they just can't see eye to eye with. The narrator reflects on how, after returning from the East last autumn, he wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever. He exempts Gatsby from this feeling, because Gatsby represents everything the narrator has an unaffected scorn for. The narrator describes Gatsby as having an extraordinary gift for hope and a romantic readiness that he has never found in any other person. At the end of the passage, the narrator reflects on how Gatsby turned out all right in the end, despite the challenges he faced. The passage describes the author's background and how he came to move to the East Coast. He reflects on how different the East Coast felt from the Midwest and how he enjoyed his time there. The narrator moves to the country alone, but soon meets a man who makes him feel less lonely. He buys books on finance and plans to read them over the summer. The passage describes the author's experience living in one of the "strangest communities in North America" - two large eggs shaped islands off the coast of Long Island. The author lived on the less fashionable of the two islands, West Egg. The passage describes Gatsby's mansion and the Buchanans' house across the water. The narrator reflects on how he used to know Tom in college and how Tom and Daisy have become much wealthier since then. The narrator wonders why they came East.

Last chunk: spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. It was Gatsby’s mansion. Or, rather, as I didn’t know Mr. Gatsby, it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. My own house was an eyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had been overlooked, so I had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbour’s lawn, and the consoling proximity of millionaires—all for eighty dollars a month.  Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom Buchanans. Daisy was my second cousin once removed, and I’d known Tom in college. And just after the war I spent two days with them in Chicago.  Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven—a national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savours of anticlimax. His family were enormously wealthy—even in college his freedom with money was a matter for reproach—but now he’d left Chicago and come East in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for instance, he’d brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake Forest. It was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that.  Why they came East I don’t know. They had spent a year
