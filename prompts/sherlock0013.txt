Story so far:  The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle is a free eBook that can be used by anyone in the United States with very few restrictions. The eBook is updated regularly and is available in English. Sherlock Holmes was not a man who felt emotion, except for one woman: Irene Adler. He respected her for her intelligence and ability to read people, but their relationship was never romantic. Sherlock Holmes is still living in Baker Street and is still interested in crime. Watson sees him one night and they catch up. Sherlock Holmes deduces that Watson has gained weight and gone into practice again, based on his appearance. The passage describes how Sherlock Holmes deduces various things about a person based on their appearance. He explains that it is simple to do once you know how, but that most people are baffled by the process. A man receives a note asking him to meet a masked visitor at 8:15 to discuss a matter of great importance. The man has no idea what the meeting could be about. The passage discusses a note written on paper that is strong and stiff, with a peculiar texture. The paper is from Bohemia, and the note was written by someone who is likely well-to-do. A man enters who is very tall with a muscular build. He is richly dressed. A man wearing a mask enters and Holmes deduces that he is from Bohemia. The man introduces himself as the Count Von Kramm. A man who wishes to remain anonymous visits Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, asking them to swear to secrecy for two years and promising that at the end of that time, the matter will be of no importance. The man explains that the matter involves the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia, and that it has the potential to grow into a scandal that could seriously damage the family's reputation. The passage describes a meeting between Sherlock Holmes and a man who later reveals himself to be the King of Bohemia. The King explains that he is seeking Holmes's help in a delicate matter concerning a woman named Irene Adler. The King of Bohemia has hired Sherlock Holmes to retrieve some compromising letters that he wrote to a young woman. However, the woman refuses to sell them or return them, and several attempts to steal them have failed. The speaker's employer has been threatened by Irene Adler, who has a compromising photograph of the employer. Adler has said she will send the photograph to the employer's fiancée's family unless the employer breaks off the engagement. The speaker is sure that Adler has not sent the photograph yet, because she said she would do so on the day the engagement is publicly announced (next Monday).

Last chunk: my pay ransacked her house. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has been waylaid. There has been no result.”  “No sign of it?”  “Absolutely none.”  Holmes laughed. “It is quite a pretty little problem,” said he.  “But a very serious one to me,” returned the King reproachfully.  “Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?”  “To ruin me.”  “But how?”  “I am about to be married.”  “So I have heard.”  “To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end.”  “And Irene Adler?”  “Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She has the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most resolute of men. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no lengths to which she would not go—none.”  “You are sure that she has not sent it yet?”  “I am sure.”  “And why?”  “Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday.”  “Oh, then we have three days yet,” said Holmes with a yawn. “That is very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the present?”  “Certainly. You will find me at the
