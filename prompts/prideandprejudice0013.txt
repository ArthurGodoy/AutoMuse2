Story so far:  This is a Project Gutenberg eBook of Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. It is available for free online and can be reused under the Project Gutenberg License. Mr. and Mrs. Bennet discuss the news that Netherfield Park has been let to a wealthy young man from up north. The passage describes Mr. Bennet's reaction to his wife's suggestion that they visit Mr. Bingley, a wealthy single man who is moving into the neighborhood. Mr. Bennet is not interested in meeting Mr. Bingley, but his wife insists that they do so. Mr. Bennet is over scrupulous and is preventing Mr. Bingley from marrying one of his daughters. He is concerned that they are all silly and ignorant, but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters. Mr. Bennet is an odd mixture of quick wit, sarcasm, and caprice, something his wife has not been able to understand fully after 23 years. Mrs. Bennet is a woman of low intelligence and bad temper. Their main goal in life is to get their daughters married off. When Mr. Bennet unexpectedly announces he is going to visit Mr. Bingley, Elizabeth is the only one who knows why. The passage discusses Mr. Bingley and whether or not he will be introduced to Mrs. Long. It is concluded that Mrs. Bennet will not do the introducing because she does not know him well enough herself. The girls' father will take it upon himself to decline Mr. Bingley's acquaintance after Mrs. Bennet declares she is sick of him. The passage describes Mr. Bennet's reaction to his wife's news that their girls had met a new young man. He is pleased and amused, and predicts that the man will soon be asking one of them to dance. His wife and daughters then try to get more information about him from Mr. Bennet, but he is evasive. Lady Lucas reports that Bingley is young, handsome, and agreeable, and that he plans to attend the next assembly with a large party. Mrs. Bennet is pleased at the prospect of one of her daughters marrying Bingley, and an invitation to dinner is dispatched. However, Bingley must go to town the following day and is unable to accept. Mr. Bingley arrives in Hertfordshire and is quickly followed by rumors that he is bringing a large party of twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the ball. Upon his arrival, it is revealed that he has only brought six people with him. Mr. Bingley is a good-looking man with easy manners, while his sisters are fashionable women. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, looks like a gentleman, and his friend Mr. Darcy is a tall and handsome man who quickly catches the attention of the room. Mr. Darcy is a wealthy man who is considered to be very handsome, but he is also very proud and arrogant. He spends most of the evening at a ball walking around the room, and people hope he will not return. Mrs. Bennet is one of the people who strongly dislikes him. The passage describes Mr. Darcy's conversation with Mr. Bingley about the Bennet sisters. Mr. Darcy is not interested in dancing with any of the Bennet sisters, but Mr. Bingley finds them all very pleasant and pretty. Mr. Darcy is rude to Elizabeth and she is not pleased.

Last chunk: do you mean?” and turning round, he looked for a moment at       Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly       said, “She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I       am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies       who are slighted by other men. You had better return to your       partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with       me.”        Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and       Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him. She       told the story, however, with great spirit among her friends; for       she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in       anything ridiculous.        The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.       Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the       Netherfield party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she       had been distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified       by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way.       Elizabeth felt Jane’s pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned       to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the       neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough       to be never without partners, which was all that they had yet       learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good       spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which       they were
