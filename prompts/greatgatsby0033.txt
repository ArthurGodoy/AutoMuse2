But above the grey land and the drifting dust, you can see the blue and gigantic eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg. Tom Buchanan's mistress lived in a small, yellow brick building on the edge of a waste land. One afternoon, Tom took his friend to meet her. The friend was not interested in meeting her, but Tom was insistent. The building contained three shops, one of which was for rent. George B. Wilson is the owner of a struggling garage. When Tom and the narrator enter, Wilson seems hopeful that they will buy a car. Tom is unimpressed by the garage and tells Wilson that he may take his business elsewhere.

She is now much louder and more assertive than before. Mrs. McKee compliments her dress and Mrs. Wilson dismisses it. Mrs. McKee is being pursued by Mr. McKee. If Chester could only get you in that pose I think he could make something of it.  We all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson, who removed a strand of hair from over her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile. Mr. McKee regarded her intently with his head on one side, and then moved his hand back and forth slowly in front of his face.  I should change the light, he said after a moment. Id like to bring out the modelling of the features. And Id try to get hold of all the back hair.  I wouldnt think of changing the light, cried Mrs. McKee. I think its  Her husband said Sh! and we all looked at the subject again, whereupon Tom Buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet.  You McKees have something to drink, he said. Get some more ice and mineral water, Myrtle, before everybody goes to sleep.  I told that boy about the ice. Myrtle raised her eyebrows in despair at the shiftlessness of the lower orders. These people! You have to keep after them all the time.  She looked at me and laughed pointlessly. Then she flounced over to the dog, kissed it with ecstasy, and swept into the kitchen, implying that a dozen chefs awaited her orders there.  Ive done some nice things out on Long Island, asserted Mr. McKee.  Tom looked at him blankly.  Two of them we have framed downstairs.  Two what? demanded Tom.  Two studies. One of them I call Montauk PointThe Gulls, and the other I call Montauk PointThe Sea.  The sister Catherine
