The passage describes Mr. Bennet's reaction to his wife's suggestion that they visit Mr. Bingley, a wealthy single man who is moving into the neighborhood. Mr. Bennet is not interested in meeting Mr. Bingley, but his wife insists that they do so. Mr. Bennet is over scrupulous and is preventing Mr. Bingley from marrying one of his daughters. He is concerned that they are all silly and ignorant, but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters. Mr. Bennet is an odd mixture of quick wit, sarcasm, and caprice, something his wife has not been able to understand fully after 23 years. Mrs. Bennet is a woman of low intelligence and bad temper. Their main goal in life is to get their daughters married off. When Mr. Bennet unexpectedly announces he is going to visit Mr. Bingley, Elizabeth is the only one who knows why.

Lady Lucas reports that Bingley is young, handsome, and agreeable, and that he plans to attend the next assembly with a large party. Mrs. Bennet is pleased at the prospect of one of her daughters marrying Bingley, and an invitation to dinner is dispatched. However, Bingley must go to town the following day and is unable to accept. Mr. Bingley arrives in Hertfordshire and is quickly followed by rumors that he is bringing a large party of twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the ball. Upon his arrival, it is revealed that he has only brought six people with him. Mr. Bingley is a good-looking man with easy manners, while his sisters are fashionable women. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, looks like a gentleman, and his friend Mr. Darcy is a tall and handsome man who quickly catches the attention of the room.

Mrs. Bennet is delighted with Mr. Bingley, who she thinks is very handsome, and his sisters, who she thinks are charming women.

This passage discusses Mr. Darcy's perceived rudeness at a ball, with Miss Bingley claiming he is much more agreeable among his intimates.

However, Elizabeth points out that Jane does not yet know enough about the man to be certain of her feelings. Charlotte wishes Jane well.

Last chunk: the business, and a brother       settled in London in a respectable line of trade.        The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most       convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually       tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to       their aunt and to a milliner’s shop just over the way. The two       youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly       frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than       their sisters’, and when nothing better offered, a walk to       Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish       conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the       country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some       from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both       with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia       regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter,       and Meryton was the headquarters.        Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most       interesting intelligence. Every day added something to their       knowledge of the officers’ names and connections. Their lodgings       were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the       officers themselves. Mr. Philips visited them all, and this       opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before. They       could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingley’s large
