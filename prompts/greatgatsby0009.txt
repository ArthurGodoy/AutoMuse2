Story so far:  This passage is from the Project Gutenberg eBook of The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The eBook is available for free to anyone in the United States and most other parts of the world, with few restrictions. The Great Gatsby is a novel about a man who is trying to win back the love of his life. The author reflects on some advice they received to not be so quick to judge others, and how this has led to them learning more about people. However, they admit that there are still some people they just can't see eye to eye with. The narrator reflects on how, after returning from the East last autumn, he wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever. He exempts Gatsby from this feeling, because Gatsby represents everything the narrator has an unaffected scorn for. The narrator describes Gatsby as having an extraordinary gift for hope and a romantic readiness that he has never found in any other person. At the end of the passage, the narrator reflects on how Gatsby turned out all right in the end, despite the challenges he faced. The passage describes the author's background and how he came to move to the East Coast. He reflects on how different the East Coast felt from the Midwest and how he enjoyed his time there. The narrator moves to the country alone, but soon meets a man who makes him feel less lonely. He buys books on finance and plans to read them over the summer. The passage describes the author's experience living in one of the "strangest communities in North America" - two large eggs shaped islands off the coast of Long Island. The author lived on the less fashionable of the two islands, West Egg. The passage describes Gatsby's mansion and the Buchanans' house across the water. The narrator reflects on how he used to know Tom in college and how Tom and Daisy have become much wealthier since then. The narrator wonders why they came East. The passage describes a wealthy man named Tom Buchanan, who has changed since the narrator last saw him. He is now arrogant and has a commanding presence. The narrator is visiting his home, which is an elaborate mansion. Tom is standing on the porch, and the narrator can see that he is a very powerful man. The passage describes a man who is physically strong and imposing, with a gruff voice that conveys a touch of contempt. The man is talking to the narrator on a porch, pointing out the features of his home. He is polite but abrupt, and the narrator gets the impression that he is not entirely comfortable in his own skin.

Last chunk: those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat. It was a body capable of enormous leverage—a cruel body.  His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked—and there were men at New Haven who had hated his guts.  “Now, don’t think my opinion on these matters is final,” he seemed to say, “just because I’m stronger and more of a man than you are.” We were in the same senior society, and while we were never intimate I always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.  We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.  “I’ve got a nice place here,” he said, his eyes flashing about restlessly.  Turning me around by one arm, he moved a broad flat hand along the front vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half acre of deep, pungent roses, and a snub-nosed motorboat that bumped the tide offshore.  “It belonged to Demaine, the oil man.” He turned me around again, politely and abruptly. “We’ll go inside.”  We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-coloured space, fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end. The windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze blew through
