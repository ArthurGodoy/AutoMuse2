Story so far:  This is a Project Gutenberg eBook of Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. It is available for free online and can be reused under the Project Gutenberg License. Mr. and Mrs. Bennet discuss the news that Netherfield Park has been let to a wealthy young man from up north. The passage describes Mr. Bennet's reaction to his wife's suggestion that they visit Mr. Bingley, a wealthy single man who is moving into the neighborhood. Mr. Bennet is not interested in meeting Mr. Bingley, but his wife insists that they do so. Mr. Bennet is over scrupulous and is preventing Mr. Bingley from marrying one of his daughters. He is concerned that they are all silly and ignorant, but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters. Mr. Bennet is an odd mixture of quick wit, sarcasm, and caprice, something his wife has not been able to understand fully after 23 years. Mrs. Bennet is a woman of low intelligence and bad temper. Their main goal in life is to get their daughters married off. When Mr. Bennet unexpectedly announces he is going to visit Mr. Bingley, Elizabeth is the only one who knows why. The passage discusses Mr. Bingley and whether or not he will be introduced to Mrs. Long. It is concluded that Mrs. Bennet will not do the introducing because she does not know him well enough herself. The girls' father will take it upon himself to decline Mr. Bingley's acquaintance after Mrs. Bennet declares she is sick of him. The passage describes Mr. Bennet's reaction to his wife's news that their girls had met a new young man. He is pleased and amused, and predicts that the man will soon be asking one of them to dance. His wife and daughters then try to get more information about him from Mr. Bennet, but he is evasive. Lady Lucas reports that Bingley is young, handsome, and agreeable, and that he plans to attend the next assembly with a large party. Mrs. Bennet is pleased at the prospect of one of her daughters marrying Bingley, and an invitation to dinner is dispatched. However, Bingley must go to town the following day and is unable to accept. Mr. Bingley arrives in Hertfordshire and is quickly followed by rumors that he is bringing a large party of twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the ball. Upon his arrival, it is revealed that he has only brought six people with him. Mr. Bingley is a good-looking man with easy manners, while his sisters are fashionable women. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, looks like a gentleman, and his friend Mr. Darcy is a tall and handsome man who quickly catches the attention of the room. Mr. Darcy is a wealthy man who is considered to be very handsome, but he is also very proud and arrogant. He spends most of the evening at a ball walking around the room, and people hope he will not return. Mrs. Bennet is one of the people who strongly dislikes him.

The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine       figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than       Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about       half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned       the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud, to       be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his       large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most       forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be       compared with his friend.        Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the       principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved,       danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and       talked of giving one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable       qualities must speak for themselves. What a contrast between him       and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and       once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other       lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the       room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His       character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man       in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there       again. Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet,       whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into       particular
