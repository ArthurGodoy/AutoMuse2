The passage describes the author's excitement at the prospect of exploring the Arctic, which he imagines as a land of beauty and wonder. The author is discussing their motivations for embarking on a voyage to the North Pole, and how they hope to make various discoveries that will benefit all of humanity. They conclude by expressing their excitement for the journey ahead. The speaker recalls how, as a child, they were fascinated by their uncle's library of books on voyages of discovery. Despite their education being neglected, they read these books avidly and dreamed of going on such voyages themselves. These dreams faded when they discovered poetry and realized that they could have their own niche in the world of literature. However, when they inherited their cousin's fortune, they decided to pursue their earlier dream of going on a great voyage of discovery. For this, they trained their body to endure hardship and studied various sciences. The narrator is an adventurer who has decided to embark on a long and difficult journey. They are aware of the dangers involved, but feel that the rewards are worth the risks. They are confident in their abilities, but sometimes find it difficult to maintain their spirits.

Some years ago he loved a young Russian lady of moderate fortune, and having amassed a considerable sum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match. He saw his mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in tears, and throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her, confessing at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor, and that her father would never consent to the union. My generous friend reassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover, instantly abandoned his pursuit. He had already bought a farm with his money, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he bestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his prize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young woman’s father to consent to her marriage with her lover. But the old man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend, who, when he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her inclinations. “What a noble fellow!” you will exclaim. He is so; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk, and a kind of ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct the more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which otherwise he would command.
