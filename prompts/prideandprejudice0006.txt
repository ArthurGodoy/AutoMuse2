Story so far:  This is a Project Gutenberg eBook of Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. It is available for free online and can be reused under the Project Gutenberg License. Mr. and Mrs. Bennet discuss the news that Netherfield Park has been let to a wealthy young man from up north. The passage describes Mr. Bennet's reaction to his wife's suggestion that they visit Mr. Bingley, a wealthy single man who is moving into the neighborhood. Mr. Bennet is not interested in meeting Mr. Bingley, but his wife insists that they do so. Mr. Bennet is over scrupulous and is preventing Mr. Bingley from marrying one of his daughters. He is concerned that they are all silly and ignorant, but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters. Mr. Bennet is an odd mixture of quick wit, sarcasm, and caprice, something his wife has not been able to understand fully after 23 years. Mrs. Bennet is a woman of low intelligence and bad temper. Their main goal in life is to get their daughters married off. When Mr. Bennet unexpectedly announces he is going to visit Mr. Bingley, Elizabeth is the only one who knows why. The passage discusses Mr. Bingley and whether or not he will be introduced to Mrs. Long. It is concluded that Mrs. Bennet will not do the introducing because she does not know him well enough herself.

She has two       nieces of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I       have no opinion of her.”        “No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that       you do not depend on her serving you.”        Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to contain       herself, began scolding one of her daughters.        “Don’t keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven’s sake! Have a little       compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.”        “Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she       times them ill.”        “I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty fretfully.       “When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?”        “To-morrow fortnight.”        “Aye, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come       back till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to       introduce him, for she will not know him herself.”        “Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and       introduce Mr. Bingley to _her_.”        “Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted       with him myself; how can you be so teasing?”        “I honour your circumspection. A fortnight’s acquaintance is       certainly very little. One cannot know what a man really is by       the end of a fortnight. But if _we_ do not venture
