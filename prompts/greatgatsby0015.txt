Story so far:  This passage is from the Project Gutenberg eBook of The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The eBook is available for free to anyone in the United States and most other parts of the world, with few restrictions. The Great Gatsby is a novel about a man who is trying to win back the love of his life. The author reflects on some advice they received to not be so quick to judge others, and how this has led to them learning more about people. However, they admit that there are still some people they just can't see eye to eye with. The narrator reflects on how, after returning from the East last autumn, he wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever. He exempts Gatsby from this feeling, because Gatsby represents everything the narrator has an unaffected scorn for. The narrator describes Gatsby as having an extraordinary gift for hope and a romantic readiness that he has never found in any other person. At the end of the passage, the narrator reflects on how Gatsby turned out all right in the end, despite the challenges he faced. The passage describes the author's background and how he came to move to the East Coast. He reflects on how different the East Coast felt from the Midwest and how he enjoyed his time there. The narrator moves to the country alone, but soon meets a man who makes him feel less lonely. He buys books on finance and plans to read them over the summer. The passage describes the author's experience living in one of the "strangest communities in North America" - two large eggs shaped islands off the coast of Long Island. The author lived on the less fashionable of the two islands, West Egg. The passage describes Gatsby's mansion and the Buchanans' house across the water. The narrator reflects on how he used to know Tom in college and how Tom and Daisy have become much wealthier since then. The narrator wonders why they came East. The passage describes a wealthy man named Tom Buchanan, who has changed since the narrator last saw him. He is now arrogant and has a commanding presence. The narrator is visiting his home, which is an elaborate mansion. Tom is standing on the porch, and the narrator can see that he is a very powerful man. The passage describes a man who is physically strong and imposing, with a gruff voice that conveys a touch of contempt. The man is talking to the narrator on a porch, pointing out the features of his home. He is polite but abrupt, and the narrator gets the impression that he is not entirely comfortable in his own skin. The passage describes a room with blowing curtains and two young women who appear to be floating on a couch. The younger woman is completely still, and the other girl laughs when she sees the narrator. The narrator is happy and feels paralyzed by the scene. The person narrator is talking about Daisy, a girl he is cousins with. He describes her as being very charismatic and having a voice that is mesmerizing. He talks about how she always seemed to be having exciting adventures and how everyone who met her seemed to fall in love with her. This passage describes a scene in which the characters are discussing a trip to New York. Miss Baker says she is in training and does not want any cocktails. The passage describes a dinner party at which the speaker is introduced to a young woman named Daisy. Daisy tells the speaker that she knows somebody in West Egg, and the speaker realizes that she must be talking about Gatsby. Tom Buchanan, another guest at the party, then takes the speaker away from Daisy. Miss Baker and Daisy discuss making plans and then Tom interrupts them. Daisy and Miss Baker then talk about how different life is in the West. Tom is a pessimist who believes that the white race is going to be "utterly submerged" by other races unless they take action. Daisy agrees with him and Miss Baker tries to change the subject.

Last chunk: nothing in particular by this remark, but it was taken up in an unexpected way.  “Civilization’s going to pieces,” broke out Tom violently. “I’ve gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read The Rise of the Coloured Empires by this man Goddard?”  “Why, no,” I answered, rather surprised by his tone.  “Well, it’s a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is if we don’t look out the white race will be—will be utterly submerged. It’s all scientific stuff; it’s been proved.”  “Tom’s getting very profound,” said Daisy, with an expression of unthoughtful sadness. “He reads deep books with long words in them. What was that word we—”  “Well, these books are all scientific,” insisted Tom, glancing at her impatiently. “This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It’s up to us, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will have control of things.”  “We’ve got to beat them down,” whispered Daisy, winking ferociously toward the fervent sun.  “You ought to live in California—” began Miss Baker, but Tom interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair.  “This idea is that we’re Nordics. I am, and you are, and you are, and—” After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a slight nod, and she winked at me again. “—And we’ve produced all the things that go to make civilization—oh, science and art, and all that. Do you see?”  There was something pathetic in his concentration, as if his complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough
